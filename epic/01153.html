<p>Vahn quickly realized that having sex with Da Vinci was going to be significantly different than his past experiences. Though her face had a healthy blush on it, the focus in Da Vinci's eyes didn't fade even after he helped loosen her up for nearly twenty minutes straight. Both his tongue and fingers were very dexterous and, though it felt like he was becoming absentminded due to the aroma emanating from her body, Vahn was confident in his skills.</p><p>Even without asking, he knew she was lessening her 'burden' by having her sub-processes focus on other things, leaving only a handful to pay attention to what they were doing. Still, even with her stoic and observant expression, there were moments when Da Vinci's body would tense up, causing her toes to curl as her hips twitched madly. It was at these moments that Vahn realized he was very reliant on his ability to 'see' and 'feel' the internal structure of his partner as, without being able to sense Da Vinci's rhythm, he had to learn and memorize all of her sensitive spots by memory and intuition alone...</p><p>Fortunately, due to her body being 'perfect', Vahn actually had a lot of experience to work from after dealing with Goddesses like Freya. With his [Hands of Nirvana], he could send constant echoes of pleasure through Da Vinci's body and, though her eyes didn't waver, it was obvious she was feeling it from how sloppy and steamy her pliant cavern had become. Vahn almost felt like he was drinking from a leaky tap, savoring the somewhat bitter yet sickly sweet nectar flowing endlessly from Da Vinci's body. He knew she had to have some kind of 'skill' related to her aroma and taste as, with the exception of Elves and Goddesses like Demeter, he couldn't recall anyone more pleasant to go down on...</p><p>Though he could have continued for a while, it was Da Vinci who eventually pat his head around the twenty-minute mark, her voice tinged with heat as she informed, "I'm more than ready...I appreciate your efforts...but this is a bit much...don't you think...?" Even if she was relatively calm, that didn't mean Da Vinci was able to completely ignore the state of her body. Her breathing was becoming steadily more ragged while an ache she had never experienced before spread through her body, carrying a pleasant yet frustrating heat along with it. In her past life, which she had set aside from the very moment Vahn called her into this world, Da Vinci had believed the relations between men and women were sickening.</p><p>Da Vinci had died a virgin as a result of being fonder of men than women, a secret she had only shared with her contemporary, Michelangelo. Unfortunately, she didn't realize until later in her life that she hadn't actually hated the idea of men and women being together; she resented the fact she couldn't be the woman receiving the passionate attention of the few men she respected. Thus, in the later years of her life, Da Vinci attempted to design the 'perfect' body she wished could have been her own, using the wife of one of the men she had loved as a template to create her 'ideal beauty'. Now that she had been reborn, only moments after accepting her death, Da Vinci was determined to experience the things she had missed out on in life...</p><p>When Vahn set her hips down on the bed, Da Vinci brought herself to a seated position before placing her hands on his chest and trying to push him back. Vahn was, thankfully, very cooperative as, in an effort to experience what a 'normal' woman would go through, Da Vinci hadn't put much focus into increasing the parameters of this body. Then, after licking her lips in a seductive manner that caused Vahn's brows to rise as she said, "I've always wanted to try this...now it's my turn to help you get ready..." With that said, Da Vinci moved her hair aside before bending hunching her body over in a surprising display of flexibility as she unhesitantly took Vahn's glans into her mouth. This wasn't the most surprising part, however, as Da Vinci seemed intent to discover her limits as she angled her head and neck in an attempt to try and take his full length all at once...</p><p>Though he would normally take the lead in these kinds of situations, Vahn knew the relationship between him and Da Vinci was distinctly different than his other relationships. In a way, they were better friends than they were lovers and, instead of focusing more on the emotional connection of having sex, it was clear that Da Vinci was more focused on the experience of sex itself. She was the type that wanted to try many different things and, as he was also more than a little curious to see what she would 'learn', Vahn just rested his hand on the back of Da Vinci's head and enjoyed her exploration of his body.</p><p>To her credit, she was a 'very' quick learner and, after only twenty seconds of trying to adjust herself, Da Vinci had placed her hands on his hips before angling her head in such a way that the tip of his penis curved into her throat, bringing her lips her his mons pubis in a single decisive motion. Though this made Da Vinci gag, it was a relatively muted reaction as she had already prepared herself before the attempt. Then, while he was still making a slight bulge in her throat, Da Vinci did something that caused a shiver to run up Vahn's spine as her mouth formed a vacuum around his member before slowly pulling away from his hips.</p><p>If he were a normal man, Vahn felt like his glans might have exploded from the almost unbelievable amount of suction that was only lessened when Da Vinci exhaled through her nose after 'failing' to move any further. From her perspective, it felt like her lungs were going to collapse from the pressure differential so she gave Vahn some 'leniency' without bursting his almost painfully swollen glans. Then, after releasing it from her mouth, Da Vinci grabbed Vahn's member with her left hand before twirling her tongue around the slightly pulsing glans and trying several other techniques, each more masterful than the last...</p><p>After almost twenty minutes on the dot, Da Vinci flicked her tongue one last time on Vahn's urethra before commenting, "You were supposed to have ejaculated by now. Am I doing something wrong?" As Vahn was undoubtedly the 'expert' on such things, Da Vinci could only defer to him since she was still inexperienced. Though she could tell her techniques were effective, to the point it actually made her a little happy to see some of Vahn's reactions, it was clearly not enough since Vahn's penis only produced an infinite supply of surprisingly sweet pre-cum without ever releasing what she had been anticipating. Her only experience was tasting her own in the past, a rather bitter and embarrassing memory, so Da Vinci wanted to know Vahn's taste to overwrite that distasteful memory...</p><p>Since he had been caught up in 'experiencing' Da Vinci's various techniques, Vahn realized he had been instinctually holding himself back. He had the habit of matching the rhythm of the woman he was with and, without being able to sense the internal structure of Da Vinci's body, Vahn had been more focused on 'himself' than their shared experience. This was rather embarrassing, especially when he had to give a wry smile and explain, "You did well...sorry, this one is my bad. If you want, we can continue..." As it was 'very' rare for him to ever have to make excuses when having sex, Vahn had forgotten how awkward it felt. This reaction seemed to appease Da Vinci, however, as she gave an elegant giggle before grabbing his member with both hands, massaging it as she lightly sucked on the tip.</p><p>This time, Vahn was paying more attention and, as it was very clear Da Vinci was expecting him to ejaculate, he answered her expectations without much suspense. To her credit, Da Vinci hadn't been caught off guard in the least and, instead of accidentally choking, she used her tongue to block the back of her throat, allowing Vahn's semen to build in her mouth before she began swallowing it in large audible gulps. She was surprised by the volume but, consider who she was with, Da Vinci just credited it to Vahn's propensity for 'excess'. He was the type that always tried to perform beyond expectations, allowing Da Vinci to understand he was trying to 'surprise' her. Eventually, she had to squeeze the base of his member since there was an almost steady flow of the uncharacteristically sweet yet viscous liquid, to the point she could hardly keep up with swallowing it due to how it would stick to her throat...</p><p>As Fenrir was the only person who was 'fond' of fellatio, at least in his current Record, Vahn knew he had gone a bit overboard when Da Vinci suddenly tried to stimy the flow by squeezing the base of his penis. She had been gulping it down rather fervently so he assumed she had been enjoying the taste, perhaps using it to rechange her own internal reserves. It was currently impossible for him to know what exactly was taking place inside her body so, without Da Vinci clearly explaining things to him, Vahn could only make assumptions based on her reactions.</p><p>After endeavoring to prevent any spillage, Da Vinci finally raised her head, her brow now dotted with small beads of sweat as she looked up at Vahn with an expression filled with blame and said, "I know I said you could do whatever you want with this body, but I'd rather avoid choking to death on your semen..." These words caused Vahn's face to become slightly red, his eyes wandering around in their sockets as if he were looking for an excuse. Da Vinci found this reaction somewhat adorable as, in most circumstances, Vahn was generally very composed. She was now seeing a completely new side of him and, though it felt like she was 'wasting' time on these interactions, Da Vinci was surprised by the fact she didn't actually mind it all that much...</p><p>While Vahn was fumbling for an excuse within his mind, Da Vinci decided it would be interesting to take the initiative herself. Though she had already realized this long ago, Vahn was surprisingly easy to tease if you knew how to push his buttons. She had been intending to let him do whatever he wanted, as it had been her dream for many years to receive the passionate affection of a man, but Da Vinci was quickly learning that it felt unexpectedly fulfilling to be more aggressive. Seeing Vahn's reactions made her heart palpitate, followed by a release of dopamine that would make her brain tingle. This, when combined with the subtle echoes of pleasure still present within her body, caused Da Vinci to smile so much that her eyes were slightly squinted as she pushed Vahn onto his back and said, "I'll accept your apology..."</p><p>Though she didn't put it in herself, Da Vinci began to grind against Vahn's member, pressing it into his muscular abdomen as her own love juices continued to flow endlessly, filling in the fleshy creases and making his skin glisten beneath her. Then, taking the 'hint', Vahn grabbed Da Vinci's impossibly soft butt with his left hand, raising her hips slightly as he fixed his angle with his right. So long as they didn't take things too far, Vahn didn't mind if a woman wanted to ride him for a bit. Since it was her first time, it was better for Da Vinci to go at her own pace and, though this position was actually 'very' dangerous for a virgin, Vahn knew it was important for her to learn and experience things in a way she was comfortable with...</p><p>Feeling the almost unbearably hot glans probe near the entrance of her cavern, Da Vinci's bit her lower lip as her eyes changed for the first time since they started. It was obvious that she wanted to experience her first time directly, causing a slight moisture to build over her painting-like eyes as she slowly lowered her hips. Vahn helped guide her at the correct angle until he reached an extremely narrow yet pliant obstruction that caused Da Vinci's insides to tense upon contact. She was almost 'too tight', perhaps as a result of a misunderstanding Da Vinci had about women, causing Vahn to inhale sharply when the upper third of his penis was suddenly squeezed like it was in a fleshy vice. To exacerbate matters even further, Da Vinci began to wiggle her hips as she tried to lower her weight against him in a misguided attempt to break her own hymen. This caused Vahn's penis to bend at a painful angle before he quickly pulled her butt up, forcing her to lay against his chest and denying her attempt to 'break' his penis...</p><p>Realizing she had made a mistake, Da Vinci gave an awkward smile as she relaxed her body against Vahn's and muttered, "I guess I owe you an apology now....ufuuu..." This caused Vahn to laugh as, though it had been a 'very' shocking experience, the pain had already faded as he began pressing into the pressure points around Da Vinci's lower back and butt. Even against his [Hands of Nirvana], she was surprisingly resistant but, as he could even affect immortals like Eva, it didn't take all that long before Vahn had her insides twitching as her vice-like hold on his penis began to ease up. Then, by raising his own hips and using Da Vinci's weight, Vahn slowly buried himself deeper inside her steamy cavern as she released a hot and slightly pained breath against his neck.</p><p>For several minutes following the breaking of her hymen, Vahn just held Da Vinci's body, caressing her in a gentle manner until she commented, "I didn't expect something like pain to actually make me feel closer to you...my brain is producing a cocktail of chemicals right now...fuuuu..." Towards the end of her words, Da Vinci cautiously moved her hips as, with Vahn's hot glans poking against her cervix, she began to feel a painful 'itch' that needed to be scratched. When even small movements caused little flicks of white light to invade the periphery of her vision, Da Vinci realized she might have made her body too sensitive. Since one of her more sincere desires was to experience the pleasure of a woman, just having Vahn inside her caused more than half her processes to focus on this singular moment...</p><p>Using Da Vinci's own movements as a trigger, Vahn moved his hands to her plump posterior, sinking his fingers into the pliant flesh as he began to gently rock her hips up and down. This caused Da Vinci to squeeze her eyes shut as she tucked her head into the nape of his neck, squishing her soft breasts against him in the process. Her body was reminiscent of Hestia's in softness, combined with the sensual and mature features of someone like Anubis or Hephaestus. It was almost addicting just to have her tightly hugging him while he slowly maneuvered himself to explore the cavern she had painstakingly constructed just for him. Once she gained a bit of experience, Vahn knew Da Vinci would actually be a little 'scary' to have sex with, especially since he had no way of knowing exactly what was going on inside her body...</p><p>With the passage of time, Da Vinci was gradually adapting to the increased levels of pleasure, to the point she had enough wherewithal to begin kissing around his neck and jaw. Though she never tried to get anywhere near his lips, Vahn didn't question it and just continued to focus on his movements and the reaction of Da Vinci's body. When her began to gradually descend, followed by 'ripples' of vibrations through her entire body, Vahn timed his own release with a particularly intense wave of pleasure that caused Da Vinci to release a nasally and high pitched moan as her legs squeezed his hips in response. Then, catching Vahn by surprise, Da Vinci's insides gradually began to heat up until it quickly crested over 70 degrees Celsius, a temperature that would have overkilled a normal human being...</p><p>When she realized something was wrong, clarity was suddenly returned to Da Vinci's eyes as she weakly lifted her body with Vahn's aid and began to blink confusedly. Then, understanding he was also very concerned, Da Vinci explained, "There is a ridiculous amount of Magical Energy contained within your semen. This body has the ability to process the bodily fluids of a Magus to increase its own internal reserves. Your semen is overloading my capacity to process it...well, this body was just meant to test out your capabilities and experiment a bit. I can make a new one in a few days that is more durable..." As she said this, Da Vinci held up her arm so that Vahn could see the complex Magic Circuits, which were normally invisible, glowing with an increasing amount of intensity.</p><p>Since she didn't want Vahn to have the experience of killing someone with his lovemaking, Da Vinci quickly extricated his member from his body before nearly collapsing on the bed. Fortunately, Vahn immediately came to her support, eliciting a smile from Da Vinci as she said, "Carry me back to my workshop. I want to see if I can analyze your semen while it is within this body...maybe a flesh and blood container would prevent it from dissipating..." Since he was very aware that something was wrong, Vahn listened to Da Vinci's demands and bridal carried her into her secret workshop. Then, following her instructions, he placed her body, now covered almost head to toe in vibrant blue Magic Circuits, into the stasis container. When the pressure-resistant glass formed a seal, the inside quickly filled up with a pale blue liquid before crystalizing around Da Vinci's body which, until the very end, had a comforting smile on its face...</p><p>As the light faded from the mature Da Vinci's eyes, her younger self came to life over on the support platform she had staged it previously. She had a slightly surprised look on her face as she lightly rubbed her belly and said, "How interesting...there is a residual influence of your energy even on this body. You really are quite something, Vahn. I think your Petting Laws aren't the only thing you've been honing in your 'recreational' time. The next body I make, I'll make sure to keep in mind that you're essentially a 'God of Sex', ufufufu~."</p><p>After teasing Vahn a bit, Da Vinci tried to step off her platform, underestimating the influence of the ambient energy that had seemingly piggybacked along with her soul. Her legs felt powerless as she tumbled toward the ground, only to find her fall prevented when Vahn quickly scooped her up, a worried expression on his face as he said, "You should rest..." This elicited a sonorous giggle from Da Vinci as she cupped the side of his face with her right hand and said, "Only if you'll lay with me..." If she were to be honest, Da Vinci was still in the mood to do 'a lot' more with Vahn but, as this body was not intended for such functions, she at least wanted him to take responsibility and comfort her until she could calm down...</p><p>Understanding there wasn't any innuendo contained within Da Vinci's words, Vahn gave a curt nod before carrying her back to the bedroom. When they reached the surprisingly 'warm' room, Vahn set Da Vinci in a comfortable chair before quickly changing the bedding. This earned him another giggle from Da Vinci as she muttered, "I don't mind using the old bedding. I'm not ashamed of the fluids my own body produced..." Vahn largely ignored this comment as he knew Da Vinci was only trying to tease him but, instead of tossing the previous bedding into his Inventory, he rolled it up into a ball and set it at the side since there was a good chance Da Vinci would actually want to use it for something.</p><p>By the time Vahn had finished cleaning up, Da Vinci had already adjusted her clothing so that she was wearing a pure white babydoll styled nightgown. It was slightly transparent but, so long as there was no light behind her, it was only noticeable if you were looking closely. Since the fabric reached her knees, Vahn decided not to complain as, even if Da Vinci's current body had the appearance of a young girl, she was still more than sixty-eight years old.
