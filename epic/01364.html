<p>With the battle between Artoria and Nero coming to an end, Vahn took the opportunity to applaud them both. It had been like watching a dance between two master swordswoman and, though the end had been determined from the start; seeing how things played out was a sight to behold. If he had any critique at all, it was that Artoria should have waited for Nero's attack to complete before she ended the battle...</p><p>Hearing Vahn clapping, Artoria briefly turned her attention toward the stands; performing a proper bow before moving to help Nero stand. The latter hadn't lost consciousness but, after falling onto the bed of rose petals, she just stared toward the sky above, a contented smile on her face. When Artoria came to help her up, she briefly glanced at the former's outstretched hand before accepting it and saying, "I will become stronger. Umu, one day, I will prove my worth as a woman worthy of our Master's affection..."</p><p>Though it filled her with a fair amount of exasperation to hear Nero's remark, Artoria had made her decision prior to the battle. It would be more troublesome to leave Nero to her own devices and, with her appearance being similar to several current residents; they would all have misgivings if she were to be involved with someone other than Vahn. Nobody wanted to see someone with a similar appearance to themselves behaving in an uncouth and unrestrained manner with a man other than the one they collectively loved...</p><p>Knowing full well how licentious and free Nero was with her love, having her devote herself to Vahn was the simplest solution to the problem. This victory was merely to forcibly change the perspective of the proud Empress as; if she continued to believe she was simply above everyone else; it would be impossible to restrain her. Like this, there was a chance Artoria could restrain some of Nero's more troublesome behaviors and, in time, there was a chance Nero could become something akin to a body double...</p><p>With this in mind, Artoria restrained a sigh; instead, adopting a slight smile as she stated, "You need not trouble yourself, Empress Nero. While I may have been the victor, none present would dare claim you lack worth. Though your behavior will need to be addressed, it would be my honor to invite you into the sisterhood of the Inner Sanctum..."</p><p>Hearing Artoria's words, Nero was at a momentary loss but, after a few seconds had passed, a smile spread across her lips as she intoned an 'umu' and said, "I'll be in your care then, Empress Artoria. It would seem I have much to learn about the etiquette of the Empire. Until then, I will observe your behavior closely. Umu..."</p><p>Seeing the two similar women shake hands with each other, Vahn's smile curled up at the edges. It would be best if Artoria and the others began proactively vetting and guiding girls like Nero, Altera, Okita, and even Jeanne. Though it was normal for an Emperor to have an entourage, Vahn felt a bit of pressure whenever he was accompanied by the usual trio. It made his interactions with others a little awkward while also distancing them from the others. There wasn't much he could do about his nature so he could only rely on the patience and tolerance of the many women under his umbrella...</p><p>---</p><p>With the event coming to a conclusion, everyone participated in a banquet to turn any bitter feelings into positive rapport. Most people were rather fond of festivities so, in order to celebrate the arrival of so many new residents of the Empire; Vahn gave a small speech before enjoying delicious food and drink alongside his new companions.</p><p>As could be expected, Alexander, Nero, and even Altera took part in a few active challenges; most of which involved food and drink. Alexander had tried to challenge Karna to an arm-wrestling contest but, due to their slight inebriation, they ended up smashing the table as soon as the match began. This put a stop to such activities, even if Alexander's infectious laugh turned the incident into an entertaining affair...</p><p>At this point, there were more than fifty people attending the banquet, not even counting the small horde of Companions, several very noticeable Guardians, and a whole host of Homunculi attendants.  It made Vahn happy to see so many people gathered together; everyone having fun without caring for pretenses of status and other meaningless things. He could understand why the Gods back in the Record of Danmachi formed Familias as, while they may not care for each of their 'children' with the same degree of focus; just having a large number of people gathered together turned small events into festive celebrations.</p><p>Vahn knew many people would envy the position he was in but, even if they were given the chance to swap places with him; he doubted they would be able to truly appreciate what he had created. If they had that capability, they would have formed a small community, Kingdom, or even an Empire. Still, despite this, Vahn wanted to share happy moments like this, paving the way for others to taste even a fraction of what he experienced on a daily basis. To achieve this, he would need to carry out his plans without fail; no matter what his enemies, the world, or the cosmos threw at him...</p><p>---</p><p>Since nearly every resident of the Ivory Castle had gathered together for the banquet, Vahn used the opportunity to complete his daily rounds; intending to check up on Azathoth, Tiamat, and Semiramis in turn. The latter wasn't fond of loud celebrations so, despite having been invited to participate, she opted to remain in the Hanging Gardens; knowing full well that Vahn would eventually come to visit.</p><p>Knowing he would be stuck with Semiramis for a few hours, at the very least, Vahn opted to visit the slumbering Azathoth first. As usual, he found the infamous Outer God sleeping peacefully within the massive and comfortable bed that had been prepared for them. They rarely moved between Vahn's visits, caring little about the world around them and the universe that existed within their dreams...</p><p>Seeing the slumbering youth with a slight smile on their face, Vahn couldn't help but apologetically smile as he asked, "How are they?" in a somber tone.</p><p>Without moving in the slightest, Azathoth's youthful voice echoed within Vahn's mind, stating in a lazy but slightly happy tone, ("Some of them have done surprisingly well for themselves. It won't be long before they give in to despair, however. I can feel them break further with each death, the hope they had in escaping diminishing with every passing day~"</p><p>Hearing Azathoth's somewhat playful tone, Vahn released a small sigh as he reflected on his decision to toss various members of the Noble Faction into Azathoth's dimension. Even though the latter had done nothing to torment them, the chaotic dreamscape wasn't a place most people would be able to live. This was the most terrifying aspect of Azathoth, however, as death did not provide any form of release to those trapped within. Everything within had some form of immortality so, even if they wanted to take their own lives; they had no choice but to live on as penance for their past sins...</p><p>In a way, Azathoth was serving as the gatekeeper of 'Hell', much like how Ereshkigal had been the Queen of the Underworld during the Age of Gods. Those trapped within his dimension would keep dying over and over until they eventually broke completely; their souls effectively leaving their body to return to the cycle of reincarnation. It was an inarguably cruel punishment but, as their lives inside were lived entirely without interference, Vahn didn't actually accumulate much negative Karma; even if he felt somewhat guilty.</p><p>If he wasn't aware of the monstrous acts they had committed in life, Vahn would have granted those inside the mercy of a final death long ago. Instead, they would revive for as many people as they had killed in life; suffering the burden of their own sins...</p><p>Deciding not to ruminate over the fates of monstrous individuals, Vahn shook his head, clearing his thoughts before asking, "Is there anything you need?"</p><p>Since he didn't really care about anything but slumbering endlessly, Azathoth's laughter sounded in Vahn's head for a few moments before he answered, "Your concerns are appreciated...for now, I am content with staying here like this...my pillows are soft and my blankets are comfortable...I can think of nothing to make my current life more pleasant..."</p><p>Hearing Azathoth's usual answer, Vahn gave a curt nod before turning away and reminding, "If you think of anything, please, let me know. I'll see you tomorrow, then."</p><p>Following his parting words, Vahn began his ascent towards the surface; Azathoth's echoing in his mind, answering with a variation of their usual reply, ("Thank you for always visiting me...next time, maybe we can sleep together...I enjoy watching you interact with my dreams...")</p><p>Since he had been pretty busy with other things lately, Vahn didn't really have the time to delve into Azathoth's dimension recently. Though he could stay inside for years at a time without any seeming to pass in reality, it always left him with incongruous feelings after leaving. This didn't bother Vahn all that much but, with the current state of the world, he needed to keep to properly focus on his daily life.</p><p>Still, he didn't want Azathoth to experience anything like loneliness so, with a casual wave of his hand, he responded, "Once things settle down a bit outside, I'll be sure to explore your dreams once again. When that time comes, show me all the interesting things you've created, okay...?"</p><p>---</p><p>After leaving Azathoth's 'shrine', Vahn wasted no time in teleporting away; his destination a glowing white 'cacoon'; the outer shell that represented Tiamat's version of a Marble Phantasm. It was a place others were disallowed entry but, after placing his palm against the surprisingly warm surface; Vahn was transported to a massive cavern that appeared to be at the bottom of the sea. There was water flowing in a massive vortex more than 5km in diameter; it's overwhelming force seemingly kept at bay by an invisible membrane, one that allowed free passage while keeping out only the water and other organisms...</p><p>At the very center of this massive vortex, a 50m tall figure could be seen hovering in mid-air, its body bound by pale-golden chains as it stood ramrod straight; observing Vahn with cross-shaped pupils and uncommon pink eyes. Her aqua-blue hair, reminiscent of the sea itself, flowed gracefully around her body; a sight Vahn had grown increasingly fond of with the passage of time.</p><p>By the time he had approached the base of Tiamat's feet, she had shrunk from her 50m height down to a more natural 160cm. It was a little 'distracting' to see a 50m tall woman with virtually no clothes on so, during his previous visits, Vahn asked Tiamat to shrink down so he could easily converse with her. It was difficult to communicate with someone when their eye was bigger than you so, after the first time; where he had floated in front of her gigantic face; Vahn had ultimately asked her to reduce her size for his own convenience...</p><p>Though Tiamat hadn't spoken a single word since their first meeting, Vahn convinced himself that she was slowly growing accustomed to him. At the very least, she seemed to take all of his words to heart; even if he didn't voice them as orders. This showed that she was considerate of his words and actions as, even without conveying his intent; Tiamat hovered at a comfortable distance, presenting her head for petting. At the same time, Alaya manifested herself at a similar size, adopting a human form not all that dissimilar from her counterpart's...</p><p>Vahn knew Alaya still had the 'objective' of sleeping with him and getting impregnated but, as he had become rather fond of her over the last two years, he didn't mind pampering her. He wouldn't sleep with her until she was free from Akasha's influence but, with the amount of progress she had been making; it wouldn't be too much longer before they shared a few intimate moments. For now, she needed to be content with simple skinship; setting an example for Tiamat to follow...</p><p>(A/N: Alternate Titles: 'Just according to keikaku...(keikaku means plan)','*Casually creates a version of Hell for sinners...*','The Godhand will conquer all, in time')</p><p>https://bit.ly/2XBzAYu &lt;-(p.atreon link)</p><p>paypal.me/Einlion</p><p>Discord Invite: https://discord.gg/Jwa8PKh</p></main><div class="link-group"><a class="btn" href="01363.html">Previous</a><a class="btn" href="01365.html">Next</a></div></div><div id="readpos">0%</div></body></html>
