<p>Vahn felt his consciousness fade into darkness before a familiar 'pulling' sensation was felt in his stomach, causing him to be both excited and disoriented at the same time. Since he had been sitting down in the 'real' world, Vahn appeared within the orb sitting down in the bed where he had parted with Eva long ago. He knew it had been 'much longer' from her perspective so Vahn was prepared for things to get a little out of hand now that he had returned. Thus, when he felt an 'overwhelming' force grab his head and shoulder, Vahn wasn't really that surprised and instead found the painful incision in his shoulder strangely pleasant as a reminiscent feeling passed through his mind.</p><p>He hadn't even had time to open his eyes before Eva had already pinned him and began sucking his blood like she was completely determined to drain him dry. Vahn just hugged her body tightly in response, feeling her small body trembling in his arms as warm tears fell from her perpetually youthful face and stained the pillows below. Feeling rather emotional himself, Vahn got a sour feeling in his nose as a bit of moisture began to build up in his eyes, saying, "I'm sorry for making you wait...I missed you, Eva..." in a choked voice. This made Eva tremble even more but, instead of saying anything, Vahn felt like his blood began draining even faster...</p><p>As usual, the process made his body heat up greatly but, unlike the past, Vahn really didn't do anything to resist the building emotions and just enjoyed his contact with Eva. He noticed she was back to wearing black clothes but it was hard to know if this was because of her emotional state or just because she felt like wearing them. Since the only thing she was wearing was a set of black lingerie and a black negligee, it was a little difficult to determine and Vahn felt like he would need to pacify her later. He didn't know how long she had been 'awake' within the orb but it must have been several years, if not much longer judging by how much his surroundings had changed.</p><p>When he originally left the orb, Vahn was in a small castle built by Eva and they had a large bed within a chamber much smaller than where he was currently located. Though he was a little interested in the changes that had occurred, Vahn didn't really care about them much right now since Eva was his primary concern. Given how 'eager' she was in draining his blood, Vahn expected it would take a while and felt like it was a good opportunity to pamper her. Since he didn't want to spoil their reunion with [Hands of Nirvana], Vahn used his [Petting] and began stroking Eva's soft back through the negligee. He also brought his left hand to the small of her back and gently caressed the area, keeping in mind he shouldn't 'push' her too much before understanding her mental state.</p><p>Eva tensed up a bit at the 'long-forgotten' contact that she had dreamed about many times when her mind had been 'sealed' away. More than a thousand years had passed since the last time she saw Vahn and it was very difficult to keep such memories alive, causing Eva to become a little eccentric in her behavior. Fortunately, most of that time had been her hibernating to allow the space the opportunity to stabilize or she would have probably lost her mind. Feeling the incredible comfort coming from Vahn's touch, Eva began to sob because, though it was different than the 'intense' contact of the past, it felt like he was caressing her heart and easing a bit of the loneliness she had felt...</p><p>Vahn noticed Eva began crying even harder but it didn't seem that she was too upset, encouraging him to redouble his efforts as he began saying soothing words to calm her heart. She was obviously pained by their long separation, to an extent he probably couldn't even understand. Though she was the most powerful entity he had ever met, she suddenly seemed to fragile and Vahn felt she had actually shrunk compared to the past, primarily because his own size had increased. She was only 130cm tall while his height had increased to 175cm, taller than all the girls he associated with since he liked to give them a sense of security when he held them. He was hoping Eva felt the same way and, noticing that her trembling had slowly faded away, Vahn believed this was the case...</p><p>After about half an hour, Eva had completely replenished her internal mana reserves, once again marveling at how 'dense' the energy in Vahn's blood was. However, she didn't immediately separate from him and just began licking the area where she had bit him, noticing there were several other bite marks in the area. She realized he must have been very 'busy' with the girls in the real world, making her both annoyed and relieved at the same time. The original reason she sealed away the space was that it was very obvious that Vahn was being burdened by the time he spent in the orb. She wanted him to have time to stabilize while also 'fixing' the orb that had taken a severe amount of damage from both Vahn and Fenrir when they used [Chainbreaker] in the past.</p><p>Feeling Eva lick his neck, Vahn felt she was beginning to return to 'normal' and felt greatly relieved, bringing his hand up to the back of Eva's head and stroking her silky blond hair. At this point, Eva realized Vahn wasn't using the same technique as in the past and was vaguely aware of a formless and comfortable energy pervading through her body. It was very peculiar because, even though she was a Shinso Vampire, the energy wasn't immediately filtered by her body's natural regeneration. The comfort persisted for a long period of time after he moved his hands away, making her feel lackadaisical and a little tired.</p><p>After a few more minutes, Eva pushed against Vahn's chest and released a comfortable sigh as she sat on his stomach and looked down at this gently smiling expression. She had actually wanted to 'punish' him a bit for keeping her waiting for so long but, after being held by him for nearly an hour, Eva didn't really feel like it anymore. He had already apologized to her and Eva could tell he was very sincere about it, sensing his emotional turmoil when she was sucking his blood. She was very aware of the state of the person she was draining and could tell that Vahn really had missed her, causing any of the pent up frustration she had felt to fade away...at least a little.</p><p>With a pouting expression on her face, Eva muttered, "You shouldn't leave me waiting so long in the future...I'll forgive you, but only this once. If you do it again, expect a severe punishment..." As she spoke, Eva used the nail of her index finger and traced it over Vahn's chest, noticing his body had developed further since the last time he visited. He was much taller and had a slim and fit body that made her own ache a great deal just looking at him. It was very frustrating knowing that they couldn't really do anything because of the nature of her existence...</p><p>Vahn noticed the 'change' in Eva and was honestly surprised she wasn't more upset by the fact he had kept her waiting, especially considering they had been apart for a very long time. He realized the 'relief' she had felt at their reunion had probably overwritten her other thoughts, at least for the time being. As long as he treated her well, she probably wouldn't fall into a negative mentality and 'punish' him as she had in the past. With a smile on his face, Vahn reached out his index finger and placed it against Eva's lips, saying, "You are more beautiful when you smile..." He knew he was pressing his luck, but Vahn was confident Eva was holding back and just needed an excuse to release some of her tensions.</p><p>Opening her mouth, revealing two tiny fangs, Eva 'chomped' down on Vahn's index finger with enough force to break the skin. It was painful, but Vahn didn't really mind it much at all as Eva began sucking on his finger with a glint in her blue eyes. This was essentially her way of 'accepting' his challenge so Vahn smiled through the pain and moved his left hand to her pert little buttocks, giving it a very light pinch before grabbing it a little firmly, knowing Eva liked when he was more forward than submissive. Though she was the type to ease people, sometimes excessively, Eva also allowed herself to be on the receiving end and had often 'complained' about him not being 'manly' enough at times.</p><p>Eva grabbed his wrist and licked up the blood from his finger before saying, "You learned a new technique...it feels very comfortable, but it isn't as exciting as your old one. I'm curious to hear about what you've been doing back in the real world but that can wait for later...I wonder if you can help this old woman release some of her frustrations, my foolish little disciple...?" At this point, Eva realized what kind of 'game' Vahn was playing, causing her to feel expectant as a giddy feeling spread through her stomach. She didn't consider herself a perverse girl, not really, but being with Vahn like this made it very difficult to just 'behave' normally. He really had 'grown up' a lot since the last time they were together and Eva was interested to see what he had 'learned' while he was away...</p><p>Since he hadn't resisted the buildup of heat in his body from when Eva sucked his blood, Vahn felt like there was fire flowing through his veins when he saw the sensual look in Eva's eyes. Though she had the body of a young girl, Vahn and Eva had been very 'intimate' in the past and he had long gotten over any inhibitions he had about her appearance. Especially with entities like Juno and Kali, or the entire Pallum people, Vahn realized appearances weren't nearly as important as actual age and mental development. Thus, without holding back at all, Vahn brought his hands to Eva's butt, firmly grabbing the pert little cheeks as he massaged them with his [Hands of Nirvana].</p><p>Eva began to laugh in a very sensual manner as a small blush touched her cheeks, commenting, "Ah, this is a very familiar feeling...haaaaa..." Though it faded very quickly if he stopped, Vahn's [Hands of Nirvana] were very stimulating when he was serious about it, causing Eva to feel like her butt was on 'fire' as waves of pleasure shot up her body. When Vahn pressed the tips of his fingers into the pressure points around her lower back, Eva's back straightened and she squinted her eyes as a girlish moan escaped her lips. With a 'competitive' glint in her eyes, Eva looked down at Vahn and was very tempted to 'play' with him a bit...</p><p>Vahn noticed that Eva was getting into the mood but, before she 'attacked' him, Vahn interrupted her momentum by saying, "You know, I actually thought about how we can be more intimate with each other without having sex...do you want to try?" Because he had been looking forward to his reunion with Eva, Vahn had done a bit of 'self-study' about methods he could employ to bring her real satisfaction. He knew she was actually 'suffering' when they were together since her body felt all the urges but she was simply unable to act on them. Having sex would cause the space to destabilize further and potentially cause it to outright collapse, meaning Vahn wouldn't be able to train or make use of the orb anymore.</p><p>Hearing Vahn's words, Eva's excitement increased a fair amount because she remembered how he would always do 'interesting' things when they were together in the past. Even his [Hands of Nirvana] was a truly amazing thing since it could even overpower her 'instantaneous regeneration'. Since he seemed very 'serious' about it, Eva felt like the heat in her own body had increased greatly as she smiled and said, "Show me..." in a seductive tone. Without delay, Vahn thumbed Eva's panties with his thumbs and snapped the elastic band, causing her to frown a bit before she just allowed her clothes to dissipate entirely. All of Eva's clothing, besides the ones he had given her, had been created by her magic and could be materialized and discarded at will.</p><p>Vahn smiled when he saw Eva's naked body, not hiding his infatuation at all as his own clothing disappeared, leaving them both naked in the massive bed. Eva began breathing a little faster as the blush on her face grew deeper, a result of the rising tensions of her body after feeling Vahn's hot flesh against her own. It felt like it had been a 'very long' time since they were together like this and Eva barely resisted just 'ravishing' him outright. Vahn placed his hands near her hips and pressed his thumbs at two different points, one near the base of her abdomen and the other very close to the top of her hairless and somewhat 'dangerous' looking vagina. Though she was very thin, it was still a little puffy and made Vahn feel like a bit of a deviant for a brief moment before throwing the matter to the back of his mind.</p><p>Eva's anticipation continued to build and she was very curious about what Vahn was going to do, not minding the fact that her own fluids had started to drip out onto his abdomen. However, when he began moving her lower body towards his hips, Eva felt a bit of panic as a very hot object pressed near her butt. With a 'confident' look on his face, Vahn explained, "There is a way to have sex called intercrural, where you used the thighs and mons pubis to 'simulate' real sex. I modified it using my [Hands of Nirvana] and, well, you'll understand in a moment..." Vahn pushed Eva's butt back and let her moist lower body slide over his penis, feeling the somewhat small vulva parting around his shaft as a surprising volume of fluids drained from her body. All of Eva's bodily fluids immediately regenerated so she could produce a 'functionally infinite' amount of love nectar when she was excited, often leaving massive stains on the bed whenever they were together in the past...</p><p>As she already knew of intercrural sex, Eva felt a bit of relief since she had been worried an 'accident' may occur that would potentially endanger them both. She was 'compelled' to teach Vahn the Magia Erebea and it would be disastrous for them both if he lost the opportunity in a moment of passion. Feeling his scalding hot member rub against her lower body, Eva frowned slightly with watery eyes while biting her bottom lip. It was very pleasurable, yes, but also made her feel a little frustrated at the same time since the stimulation wouldn't really build up properly as a result of her regeneration. Vahn, however, had prepared for this as he said, "Let me know if it becomes difficult for you..." in a low voice.</p><p>Vahn had placed his thumbs around the location of Eva's cervix and her presently 'shy' clitoris, allowing his energy to diffuse through her muscles and nerves without causing any kind of stimulation at all, at least for now. When his preparations were completed, Vahn said in a somewhat sly tone, "You can move your hips now...I think you'll be surprised~." Eva furrowed her brows slightly when she heard Vahn's words but she still used his abdomen as support before rocking her hips forward. The moment she did so, however, Eva felt an invasive feeling in her lower body that made her cry out in surprise with a sensual intonation to her voice. Vahn had caused the muscles in Eva's vagina to expand and dilate in timing with her movements, simultaneously stimulating all the nerves in the area, including the nerve stem of her clitoris without touching it directly.</p><p>Eva had never felt anything like this before, causing her eyes to become somewhat watery as her breathing became heavy. She looked down at Vahn and saw his 'cheeky' expression, feeling slightly aggrieved as she bit her lower lip. Vahn felt the pressure in the bridge of his nose increase because of how adorable Eva was when she was 'pouting' like this. With a smile on his face, Vahn explained, "It's a bit awkward to admit, but I'm pretty confident when it comes to taking care of my women...we may not be able to have sex, Eva, but that doesn't mean I can't help you feel what it's like. This way, you don't have to experience any pain either..." Though she felt happy about Vahn's concern, Eva was still having a bit of trouble with the current situation because it felt like her body was 'full', something she had never expected in her wildest dreams...</p><p>Seeing that she would probably 'struggle' to move on her own, Vahn gently moved Eva's hips back while 'reversing' the flow and making the interior of her vagina contract. She released an almost whimpering moan that tickled his ears as she leaned forward slightly, using his body as a support. In as comforting a voice as he could manage, Vahn said, "Leave it to me, Eva...I'll make sure you get to experience everything as close as possible to the real thing..." Vahn knew that Eva actually worried about her figure a great deal and, treating her well in her original form was very important for her mental state. It was her greatest trauma and Vahn wanted her to be able to overcome it, at least when they were together like this...</p><p>(A/N: Alternate Titles: 'Gimme dat blood (&gt;,...,&lt;)~!','There is always a way...( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)','Vahn is very experienced...')</p><p>https://www.*******.com/user?u=14397149</p><p>paypal.me/Einlion</p><p>Discord Invite: https://discord.gg/Jwa8PKh</p></main><div class="link-group"><a class="btn" href="00624.html">Previous</a><a class="btn" href="00626.html">Next</a></div></div><div id="readpos">0%</div></body></html>
