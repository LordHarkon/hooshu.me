<p>After spending an hour on each of her backside and frontside, massaging virtually every centimeter of her body minus two extra sensitive spots, Vahn picked up the limp Circe by hooking his hands under her armpits. She had a negligible amount of weight and, due to their difference in height, Vahn was able to easily pick her up before moving to the shower area. Throughout this process, Circe just stared at him with almost sickly pink eyes as her ears and wings drooped powerlessly. She didn't even know how to think at the moment as there was a tingly sensation that filled her entire body, including her brain. The only thing she 'knew' at the moment was that Vahn was the source of the seemingly endless pleasure and comfort she was feeling. Not wanting to lose this precious treasure she had obtained, Circe had become almost unnaturally docile.</p><p>Ignoring the warmth in his body, and the intoxicatingly sweet aroma that seemed to invade his mind, ever after removing his ability to smell, Vahn sat Circe down on a small wooden bench used to aid in washing the body. Though she slouched forward powerlessly the moment he let her go, Vahn was eventually able to keep her upright with a combination of telekinesis and pressing a few points around Circe's hips and back to keep her back straight. With his almost perfect understanding of her body, Vahn was even able to insert his Source Energy into Circe's Magic Circuits, guiding her to open her wings completely and hold them open as he used the lowest setting on the showerhead to begin grooming her wings. Since he had the opportunity, Vahn counted each of her feathers while observing every minute aspect of the wings, down to the microscopic network of barbules that had minute amounts of mana flowing through them.</p><p>Though her wings weren't especially sensitive, Circe felt an ever-increasing feeling of comfort, even though she could feel that Vahn was exposing all of her secrets. She didn't even mind that he had infinitely more control over her own body than she did at the moment. There was a strange 'comfort' that came with relinquishing control and, though part of her desperately craved the moment when Vahn would lose restraint, Circe was beginning to understand that he truly wasn't like other men. Even the most Heroic individuals wouldn't have been able to keep their senses after seeing her naked, but Vahn was able to handle her body expertly without showing any signs of losing himself to passion. This awareness made Circe's heart feel fluttery as she closed her eyes and just allowed the pleasant feelings to wash over her, much like the warm water from the showerhead...</p><p>Vahn was somewhat surprised by the fact that Circe had exactly 100 feathers on each of her wings while the rest of her winged attachment only brought the total count to 312 if counting the feathers on her tiara. In exchange for having significantly fewer feathers than an actual bird, each individual feather had a mana conductivity that far outstripped materials like Mythril. They were also extremely soft to the touch on the outside while the interior, which had a smooth metallic golden sheen, was almost hot to the touch as subtle vibrations passed into his fingers when he traced the massive magic circuits that were comprised of hundreds of small circuits arranged in a complex manner that would take him months, or even years, of research to emulate...</p><p>After finishing with her wings, Vahn gently eased the tension in Circe's body while guiding her wings to rest on two white towels he had spread across the floor. They had become steamy and wet from the hot water, but Circe would probably complain if he just let her precious wings drape across the floor. She might not be reacting much, but Vahn knew she was paying close attention to everything he was doing since her brain was glowing like a lightbulb with activity. When he moved around to the front of her body, her eyelids slowly peeled open to show a deep pink bordering on red as she stared back at him with glazed, yet strangely focused, eyes. Vahn returned a smile to her before gingerly picking up her right foot, pulling out a small golden file to clean under her already pristine toenails...</p><p>When Vahn finished with each of the delicate and moderately adorable digits, he gave Circe's feet an oil rub before wiping them down with a steamed towel. From there, he used the same oil and began massaging it into her calves before slowly moving up to her knees and the soft depression behind. From there, Vahn spread Circe's legs open wide, noticing the color of her eyes deepen, before slowly applying the oil to her thigh, all the way down to her pectineus and adductor muscles. Though he was close enough to feel an almost burning heat on his hand whenever he went to the base of her thighs, Vahn made sure not to violate Circe's sacred area, even by accident. It was a little difficult to wipe around the area with a towel but, by paying close attention to his actions, Vahn managed to wash Circe's legs without any major issues.</p><p>After applying a large amount of oil to his hands, Vahn moved on from Circe's legs before using large caressing motions spread the oil over her abdomen, sides, back, breasts, and shoulders. She had an unbelievably soft body, at least compared to how tender and thin she appeared at a glance, but Vahn didn't lose his focus even as he cleaned around her breasts that, as expected, almost fit perfectly within his palm. Once he had applied the oil to almost every nook and cranny of her torso, Vahn used another steamed towel to wipe her down before folding across her lap in a vain attempt to prevent the ever-increasing potency of Circe's aroma from spreading into his body. Though this wasn't the first time he was in such a situation, Vahn's lack of inhibitions lately made it surprisingly difficult to restrain himself with a 'willing' participant right in front of him...</p><p>Releasing a hot sigh to ease his tensions a bit, Vahn picked up Circe's hand and began to file and polish each of her nails, though not before cleaning underneath the tips and around the cuticles. Then, after applying a small amount of oil to his fingers, Vahn gingerly rubbed the length of each of Circe's digits, finding her dainty fingers even more adorable than her tiny toes. Then, much like he had done for her legs, Vahn rubbed down the length of Circe's forearms, elbow, and upper arms, massaging the delicate and soft tissue for a few minutes before ultimately wiping her down with a steamed towel. With this, the last thing to clean was Circe's head, ears, and hair before giving her body one last rinse and bringing their already three-hour-long spa session to an end with a soak in the bath.</p><p>After folding another towel across Circe's lap, Vahn released another hot sigh before looking into her reddish-pink eyes, smiling as he said, "I hope this makes you properly consider your future actions...I don't give this level of service to girls who don't behave themselves..." Though she didn't answer him, Vahn could see the activity in Circe's mind, hopefully indicating she was seriously considering what he had said. Her eye color raised a few flags but, as his instincts weren't warning him of any impending danger, Vahn just accredited the change to Circe's heightened state of pleasure. With that in mind, Vahn applied a small amount of oil to his hands as he began to massage her neck and cheeks, finding the latter strangely pliant. This reminded him of how Circe would often puff out her cheeks, bringing a smile to Vahn's face as he moved on to her extra sensitive and super long ears...</p><p>Though they had been drooping somewhat pitifully for a while now, Circe's ears twitched to a sharp angle the moment he touched them. Since they would twitch wildly at even the smallest caress, Vahn had to keep a small pressure point near Circe's jawline pressed to slacken it before using his other hand to gingerly clean it, using extreme care as Circe's face became a deep shade of red in response to his actions. The moment he stopped pressing into the pressure point, Circe's now cleaned ear began to waggle madly, suffused with the same red hue as her face. By the time Vahn cleaned her other ear, Circe looked like she was on the verge of having a nosebleed and passing out, even though the entire process had only taken around three minutes. It was obvious that her ears were just as sensitive as a High Elf's, something Vahn had already expected due to how 'expressive' they were...</p><p>While Circe's ears continued to twitch sporadically, Vahn moved behind her before changing to an expensive bottle of conditioner that he had purchased through the system shop for 40,000 OP. This was supposed to be a 'full-service' experience so Vahn decided not to spare any expenses this time around to ensure that Circe wouldn't be able to fault any of his treatments. Even the oil he had been using to clean her body was valued at 28,000OP, possessing the function of revitalizing the skin and giving it a slight gloss. The best part was that it was ultimately scentless, meaning it wouldn't bother girls with sensitive noses. Back in the Record of Danmachi, it was the most commonly used oil by the girls within the Manor, the Goddesses being no exception...</p><p>As he washed Circe's long pink hair, Vahn noticed that its quality would even put fine satin to shame as, even while wet, his fingers glided through it without encountering any tangles or resistance. He had noticed this previously while patting her head, but this was Vahn's first time washing Circe's hair since she joined them. In fact, with the exception of Fenrir, he hadn't taken a bath with any of the other girls yet, though Rin had asked if he wanted to join her and Sakura earlier in the morning. With how young Sakura was, it wasn't too strange for her to still bathe with her parents, at least according to the sensibilities of the Japanese. It was common for children, especially daughters, to bathe with their parent's until around the age of 8-9, something that didn't particularly bother Vahn since he was used to more communal bathing due to his experience in Danmachi.</p><p>With Circe's long hair reaching down near her hips, creating a peculiar crescent shape even when wet, Vahn had to spend nearly twenty minutes making sure it was properly suffused with the conditioner. Then, using a specialized brush that wouldn't damage her silky hair, Vahn spent another twenty minutes brushing out the conditioner while using the showerhead on the lowest setting to make sure there was nothing left behind. He knew this was always a pleasant and comfortable experience for girls so Vahn made sure to take his time in order to give Circe the maximum amount of comfort. He made sure to periodically use the showerhead to keep her body warm so Circe was practically putty by the time he had finished.</p><p>Releasing yet another hot sigh, Vahn wiped the sweat from his brow as he looked around at the cloud of steam that now permeated through the entire room. There was a subtle pink hue that only his [Eyes of Truth] could see, causing him to periodically feel absentminded until his body would filter it out once again. At this point, Vahn imagined that any man who stepped into this room would immediately lose their minds before trying to attack the nearest woman, Circe. The pheromones produced by her body were one of the most potent aphrodisiacs he had ever observed, making the viscous liquid staining the wooden bench she had been sitting on seem especially dangerous. Vahn was slightly worried about what would happen once she soaked in the bath as his intuition told him the water itself would become an equally powerful aphrodisiac...</p><p>Deciding to trust in his body's natural resistances, Vahn lifted Circe's head by gently tilting her chin, asking, "Are you ready to take a bath...?" Then, after Circe bobbed her head in a lazy nod, Vahn picked up her body, holding her straight out since it was almost impossible to give her a bridal carry with her wings being uncooperative. This was a little awkward but Vahn managed by unequipping his shorts, the only piece of clothing he had been wearing since the start. He knew Circe would fault him if he wasn't naked so, gambling on his ability to even resist Angra Mainyu's corruption, Vahn stepped into the large bath before lowering Circe's body into the hot water.</p><p>Though he had nearly gone the route of letting her sit in his lap, Vahn ultimately decided against it since he knew direct contact between his member and the viscous fluid leaking from her lower body wouldn't end well. Even with his resistances, his body still needed to take in the foreign substance before repelling it, just like how his flesh had been corroded by Sakura's Shadow in the past. This was why he would periodically experience bouts of absentmindedness while his body had gradually become warm from exposure to Circe's pheromones. If she were to grind against him directly, Vahn had no confidence he would be able to prevent his body from reacting, even if he knew things would end there. Since he didn't want to cause unnecessary 'suffering' for himself, Vahn let Circe sit between the gap in his legs before releasing a hot sigh as he reclined against the side of the tub...</p><p>While Vahn was enjoying the hot water, Circe's eyes were focused beneath its surface as she saw his unresponsive member lurking beneath. She had never felt so tempted to try and get a rise out of someone but, after experiencing Vahn's care for such a long period of time, she had absolutely no resolve when it came to taking any action that might annoy him. Since she had recovered most of her ability to move while he had been washing her body, Circe just slumped into the water until half her face was submerged. When Vahn smiled toward her, she began blowing bubbles, even though her ears betrayed that she felt happy to have even a little bit of his attention...</p><p>This seemed to be the best way to get Vahn to show her increased affection as, after sinking his body into the water, bringing them dangerously close together, he then came to a seated position that had him towering over her due to their difference in size. Then, causing Circe's ears to stand at a sharp angle, Vahn gently embraced her body, bringing her head to rest on his chest as he stroked her back and said, "I don't mind girls with strong personalities...I don't even mind girls that want to act like spoiled Princesses...the only kind of girl I can't show affection towards are those who treat others as if they are beneath them. Try to get along with the others in the future...I promise you will be much happier if you surround yourself with friends instead of 'enemies'..."</p><p>Hearing Vahn's words, Circe felt a bit of resentment rise up in her heart as she believed it was unfair for him to use such words after everything he had done to her. Now that she had experienced the liberating feeling of entrusting her body to him, Circe felt like he was bullying her by essentially threatening to take it away if she didn't behave. She wished he would just give in to her charms and push her down in the bath as, after what he had done to her, Circe didn't even care if she lost her powers. She could potentially have Vahn's life in her hands and, with the focus he placed on family, Circe didn't believe he would be able to hate her after she got pregnant with his child. Then she could have all of his affections to herself, living like a pampered Queen that passed each day in endless comfort...</p><p>Putting what little strength she could muster into her hands, Circe pushed against Vahn's chest in a vain attempt to force him down. Fortunately, he misconstrued this as her wanting to break free from his embrace, allowing her to look up at him with her now deep red eyes. Circe felt like she 'needed' to make Vahn her own but, after seeing the calm yet 'intense' look on his face, she found her body tense up as she watched him recline against the tub once again. At this moment, Circe regained a bit of clarity, recalling that Vahn was different than any other man she had ever encountered. Even if she could somehow force him to take her virginity, the chances of her actually being able to control him after the fact were infinitesimally small. She even doubted the curse that would bind their lives together would have any effect on him as, no matter how much she tried to force him to obey, Circe knew she wouldn't have the heart to actually kill him. The only thing her action would accomplish would be betraying Vahn and earning his ire. Though he would undoubtedly take care of her and their child, Circe knew she would always be kept at arm's length from that moment onward...</p><p>Before she realized what was happening, Circe began to cry pitifully like a child, balling her tiny hands into fists as she covered her eyes and loudly sobbed. This caused Vahn to panic a bit, making Circe feel even sadder when he tightly embraced her and began apologizing while lightly patting her back. The color in her eyes flickered before changing from a deep red to a sickly pink once again as she just sobbed into his chest and lightly beat against his body with her fists. Even though he tried asking what was wrong, Circe fundamentally lacked the ability to describe how she was feeling right now. She felt as if she had suffered the greatest grievance imaginable, even though she knew it was ultimately her fault things were so complicated. All she wanted was to feel good and have someone take care of her so it felt like Vahn was bullying her by making her take responsibility for how she treated others...</p><p>---</p><p>Though it took quite some time, Circe eventually stopped bawling and simply returned his embrace in silence for several minutes before muttering, "I will try..." in a voice still tinged with a sob. Vahn had been feeling guilty from the moment she started crying so, hearing her words, he released a sigh of relief before patting her back and answering, "You are an amazing woman...I know you can do it..." He didn't quite know what Circe's thought process was that caused her to suddenly break down into tears but, feeling the energy in her body mellow out considerably, he felt she had undergone a positive change. When they finally separated, her eyes even had a color he hadn't seen before, the top still containing a pure pink color while the bottom was a soft blue. He would need to pay close attention to the changes in her eyes to know what she was feeling but, compared to the green he assumed was 'envy', the gentle blue seemed less worrisome at a glance...</p><p>With her hands still resting against Vahn's chest, Circe gave a small smile that made the room seem slightly brighter. She began to move her hands, rubbing his body and tracing the lines of his muscles in a way that made Vahn feel perturbed since she had been crying her eyes out moments before. He could see the blue in her eyes recede, the pink becoming more prominent as she asked, "Can we do this again if I'm a good girl...?" This question made Vahn feel another pang of guilt but, remembering this was the 'desired' outcome, he nodded his head and said, "Of course..." His affirmation caused the pink in Circe's eyes to fade away a bit, replaced by the gentle blue color this time as she nodded her head and said, "I've decided. I will become your personal attendant from now on. I can't imagine getting along with other girls, but I feel I might be able to do it if it's for you..."</p><p>Feeling that this was Circe's way of saying she would follow him around, Vahn's smile became a little awkward as he gently grabbed her wrists and was about to explain that he didn't want someone at his side at all times. He already had enough trouble with Alaya as, even if she wasn't visible, Vahn knew she was always watching everything he did. Circe following him around would only cause the other girls to feel awkward, especially since she wasn't the most adept when it came to interacting with other girls. Before he could make his case, however, Circe smiled even more radiantly as she said, "Don't worry. I'm not going to follow you around. I will just stay in your room and make sure it is clean and orderly. I will also cook all of your meals and even do your laundry if you want me to. In exchange, I just want to spend more time with you, even if you bring other girls around. I will do my best to get along without feeling jealous..."</p><p>As Circe spoke, Vahn saw a tiny amount of green rise up from the bottom of her eyes before fading away moments later. The smile on her face was filled with expectations so, after considering things for a brief moment, Vahn ultimately returned a smile of his own before saying, "I understand...I'll be in your care from now on..." Though Fenrir would probably butt heads with Circe a bit in the near future, Vahn figured she would be able to quickly reign in the little Nymph and establish herself as the 'highest authority' in his bedroom. If Circe was sincere in her willingness to open up to others, Fenrir would be the first major threshold she would need to overcome. After that, interacting with other girls should become relatively easy since everyone except Nobunaga got along well with her.</p><p>With Vahn agreeing with her, Circe smiled so radiantly that he almost instinctively averted his eyes due to a strange feeling of guilty plaguing his heart. This didn't persist for too long, however, as Circe caused Vahn's mind to blank for a moment when she suddenly leaned forward and said, "I want to service you..." with the same hopeful expression from earlier. Though this could mean almost anything, Vahn correctly guessed what Circe had in mind, even before she clarified, "I have always wanted to try it. Please sit on the edge of the bath and leave everything to me, okay~? This is my first time but I'll try my best to make you cum lots and lots~!"</p><p>Vahn didn't know if Circe was still trying to test him but, after watching her cry earlier, he assumed she was serious about her desire to fellate him. Her becoming his 'attendant' suddenly gained a whole new meaning as Vahn realized she would likely want to try a number of things other than outright having sex. Since he was confident in his skill, this didn't bother him all that much since her curiosity reminded him a lot of Lefiya and Ais. Thus, even though he felt like there was something slightly off about the situation, Vahn ultimately nodded his head before rubbing Circe's. Afterward, he sat on the edge of the tub, watching as Circe's eyes became almost completely pink as she began playing out the fantasies that had only existed in her mind previously...</p><p>(A/N: Alternate Titles: 'RIP Circe','Vahn is a big bully...!','He ded')</p><p>https://bit.ly/2XBzAYu &lt;-(p.atreon link)</p><p>paypal.me/Einlion</p><p>Discord Invite: https://discord.gg/mn5xMbE</p></main><div class="link-group"><a class="btn" href="01109.html">Previous</a><a class="btn" href="01111.html">Next</a></div></div><div id="readpos">0%</div></body></html>
