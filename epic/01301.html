<p>Exactly one month had passed since the start of class and, unlike most days, both the True Mage and Magic Knight classes were brought together early in the morning. They hadn't been given any prior notice to the peculiar class so many students were beginning to feel tense. If not for the ever relaxed Mordred and the rest of the girls forming the Imperial Quintet, tensions would have increased even more.</p><p>Feeling emboldened, a girl named Yvette decided to try and ease her nerves by sheepishly asking Mash, "Excuse me, Miss Kyrielight...do you know why we were all told to come here so early...?"</p><p>Hearing the girl ask her question, most of the students in the class became more attentive as Mash, with her usual smile, politely stated, "I'm afraid the particulars have not been explained to any of us. We may hail from the Empire but we're not privileged to know about events in advance. I'm just as nervous as everyone else, even if it may not seem like it on the surface..."</p><p>Yvette gave an awkward smile in response to Mash's words as, looking at the calm and collected girl, it was difficult to believe she was even remotely nervous. This wasn't something that could be said out loud, however, so Yvette just combed her fingers through the fringe of her hair, saying, "Well, I just hope nothing bad happened...I've been enjoying the classes a lot..."</p><p>Mash found Yvette's words somewhat peculiar but, before she could say anything further, the door to the classroom opened to reveal Da Vinci and Sion. This brought a prompt end to any discussions and, though there was still a lot of tension in the air, the focus of every student shifted to the two inordinately beautiful Professors.</p><p>Upon taking her place at the lectern, Da Vinci's smile blossomed into a truly breathtaking visage that seemed to help everyone in the room relax as she explained, "I'm certain everyone has questions. I'll do my best to explain everything in detail so please, relax. You aren't wrong to be nervous but what we're here to discuss isn't anything particularly dangerous or disadvantageous~"</p><p>As Da Vinci spoke, the massive monitor that had replaced the classroom's blackboard came to life. It depicted a very complex structure that looked like two pyramids welded together at their bases. This created a diamond-shaped superstructure that, upon closer observation, formed a complex network of tunnels and rooms, each listing a variety of different materials that could be found.</p><p>Though the average student had only ventured into the upper layers of the Spirit Tomb, everyone in the class was familiar with the massive dungeon beneath the school. What surprised them was how detailed the infographic provided by Da Vinci was as, unless you traded a large number of materials or points, it was impossible to get a map of the Spirit Tombs interior.</p><p>Before she could be bombarded with questions, Da Vinci explained, "Today is a very important day for each and every one of you. Today, you will establish a baseline for future growth by completing a task assigned to you based on your ranking and skill level. Each of you will be assigned to a group based on the data we have collected over the last month. There will be several different objectives, each with different ratings based on their difficulty. You may complete multiple objectives but keep in mind that, in many cases, it is wiser to return with lesser accomplishments than forcing yourself forward to your deaths. Judgment is one of the metrics you are evaluated on so consider each of your options as a team before deciding whether or not you'll put yourselves in danger..."</p><p>Some of the students had actually been wondering whether or not they would be given access to the Spirit Tomb so, hearing they suddenly had to enter and complete challenges, they were both excited and nervous. Most of them had been looking forward to measuring their growth so, while it was productive to spar against each other during training, battling against monsters was infinitely better since you didn't have to hold back.</p><p>To further excite the class, Da Vinci explained, "Over the last month, each of you has compiled a sizeable number of contribution points. I'm aware that it has been a rather popular topic so allow me to explain a bit of their use. The simplest way in which they can be used is to exchange for various materials and resources. After today, you will all be given a tablet that is synchronized with each of your Companions. Using this will allow you to access one of three different shops based on your class, overall ranking, and personal ranking. We'll go into greater detail about these different things upon the completion of today's exercise but here is a sample of what you can expect~"</p><p>At Da Vinci's behest, the monitor behind her showed a list of various items, each neatly filed into a series of columns with their picture, use, and exchange value. What surprised the students was that, by exchanging a single contribution point, they could obtain relatively rare alchemical ingredients. It was even possible to exchange for a Philosopher's Stone, something that was heavily regulated by the Mage's Association, for a meager 100 contribution points...</p><p>With even the cheaper items being of such high value, the students couldn't help but focus on the items at the very top of the list. There, various Mystic Codexes were listed, some of which could be considered a heritage item within an established family. At the very top, there were even seemingly legendary items like the [Golden Fleece] and [Decanter of Perpetuity], a highly sought after item in the Magus community due to its purported effect of restoring a person to their youth without any decrease in physical and magical capabilities...</p><p>Da Vinci waited for the students to peruse the items for a short while before breaking their idle thoughts as she explained, "This is only a small portion of the items that will be available in the shop. In truth, there is no limit to what you can obtain. So long as you work hard, even purchasing items that increase your Od, unlock your potential, strengthen your body, or grant you a lesser form of immortality can be found within the shop~"</p><p>As could be expected, Da Vinci's words caused a stir within the class as it was very difficult to believe what she was saying. However, considering what they had already experienced, a few students could be seen shaking slightly in anticipation of the future. One of them, Ophelia, couldn't resist the urge to raise her hand and, upon being recognized by Da Vinci, asked, "Professor, I wonder if even Mystic Eyes can be exchanged and purchased from the shop...?"</p><p>Ophelia was a girl that already possessed one Mystic Eye and, as a result, her life had been made very difficult. However, while it could be considered the source of her burden, it had also allowed her to establish herself as a capable Magus. Prior to joining the Department of Unified Thaumaturgical Theory, one of the avenues she had been pursuing was increasing her power to the point that it was difficult for her family to control her. If she made a good impression on a higher ranking Noble, she could avoid being married off by becoming a Governess or a bodyguard. It wasn't much better than being exploited by her family but, considering it would be a path of her own choosing, it was still the better option...</p><p>Meeting Ophelia's expectations, Da Vinci didn't even flinch as she casually answered, "I'd prefer to avoid having to answer too many questions like this but, as you are the first, I'll make an exception, Miss Phamrsolone. To reiterate my earlier statement, there are very few things you cannot purchase from the shop. The only restrictions would be your overall points, your ranking, and the evaluation of your character. We will obviously not allow someone with destructive tendencies to buy a nuclear warhead with the intent of blowing up a classroom~"</p><p>Da Vinci's words not only met Ophelia's expectations but, while it was an offhanded and casual remark, some of the students couldn't help but internally retort, ("We can buy nuclear warheads!?"). This seemed to convey there was very little they couldn't purchase, cementing Da Vinci's words in their mind, regardless of how ridiculous they seemed. At the very least, she had greatly increased the interest of each student in the shop and, now that they knew what the points were used for, those who had been slacking off over the last month began to lament...</p><p>---</p><p>After answering a few more questions and alleviating some concerns, Da Vinci began a long lecture on the various environments, monsters, and materials that could be found in the Spirit Tomb. Since it was on everyone's mind, she discussed how these could all be exchanged for points and, upon being asked how monsters could be counted, Da Vinci reminded them that their Companions were linked to the tablets so, even if they didn't bring back proof of the subjugation, they would get credit for any monsters killed. This wasn't a foolproof system, as hordes of monsters would be hard to count, but Da Vinci simply advised them to run away in such situations.</p><p>It was only after the much longer than expected lecture that the students understood why they had been asked to come in so early. Had they started at a normal time, they would have to take a break for lunch and, if they were unlucky, getting stuck overnight in the Spirit Tomb was a real possibility. It had an enchantment that made leaving after a certain point in time impossible as the 'gate' would close for a few hours during the evening. Though there were some waypoints inside, allowing those within to teleport back to the Mining City, Magi's Fair, they would be forced to turn over all acquired items as compensation.</p><p>Vahn's agreement with Solon allowed for relatively unrestricted access to the Spirit Tomb but, in exchange, everything gathered by himself and the students had to be returned to the Clock Tower. It was for this reason that he came up with the idea of a school shop as, with the virtually unlimited resources of the Empire, it wasn't that difficult to acquire the materials and items requested by the students. Though he had to put monthly, weekly, and daily restrictions on some goods, even the laziest students would be able to stockpile a considerable amount of wealth by the time they were preparing to graduate.</p><p>Unfortunately for these students, the very concept of wealth would ultimately lose its meaning once the Empire came into prominence. Only those that sought to better themselves would be able to rise above others and live comparably luxurious lifestyles as, once the market system collapsed, the only way to obtain materials and resources would be through bartering for them or earning them based on your contributions and capabilities. Through the Empire, it was possible to get resources for free but, rather than stockpile them and treat them as 'accumulated wealth', you had to actually use them for their intended purpose.</p><p>One of the primary corrupting factors within a society was wealth itself as, when one group began to accumulate and stockpile wealth, they used it to leverage their authority over others. So long as they made sure they had a monopoly on the most important resources, combined with the power to back it up, they could dictate how others lived with borderline impunity. This was only made worse when the children of such individuals, despite never having done anything to establish themselves within a community, believed they were better than others by virtue of birth alone...</p><p>It was impossible to completely root out corruption but, with a system that primarily rewarded those that put in the effort to obtain their status, Vahn hoped to prevent its spread. This was the primary justification for the existence of the Virtual World they were creating as, with unlimited freedom in the virtual world, they could prevent a lot of problems in the real world from developing. There, so long as they followed the rules of the Virtual World, it was possible for them to be veritable gods in a world of their own design. They could eat the most delicious foods, walk on the surface of stars, or play catch with literal planets...all while affecting nothing in the real world.</p><p>(A/N: Alternate Titles: 'Surprise expedition~!','I want access to that shop...','Every human is a god in their own mind.
