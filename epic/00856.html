<p>The first vision Vahn had from Artemis' perspective was far different than his expectations as it was a memory of conflict, unlike anything he had ever experienced. It wasn't recorded in any history books, but Heaven was not always a peaceful realm, especially when the first generation of gods had come into existence. Artemis came into existence towards the end of a great conflict between the Northern Pantheon and the Eastern Patheon, the culmination of several stay Divinities that had been given sentience.</p><p>Artemis' first memory was appearing naked amidst a battlefield between Zeus, his sworn brother Poseidon, and their enemies, Hachiman, Susano'o, and Fujin. Unaware of which side she represented, Zeus had moved to capture Artemis, forming a swirl of space and cloud that wrapped around her body as Poseidon created a flow of dark blue 'water' that seemed like it could fill the entirety of Heaven. It was a display of power that Vahn, and Artemis at the time, couldn't even comprehend...</p><p>After being whisked away, Zeus, body clad in pure white thunder as space around him bent and distorted, grabbed her neck in a vice-like grip, asking, "What is your name!?" Though gods didn't need to breathe, Artemis felt extremely suffocated by Zeus' pressure and wasn't able to answer his question due to the confusion she felt from just coming into existence. It didn't seem to matter to the raging and battle-hungry god, however, as his stark-white eyes danced across her body with a possessive glint contained within. With a sneer across his face, Zeus proclaimed, "I will spare your life if you swear to serve me. Soon, I will become the ruler of the Northern Pantheon and I will allow you to stay at my side if you vow to dedicate yourself to me, and me alone...!"</p><p>Filled with indignant rage, another ambient Divinity latched itself onto Artemis as she tightly gripped Zeus' wrist and spat, "I would never pledge myself to such a vile and wicked mongrel! Even a dog is more worthy of my loyalty than a vain fool who forces others to yield to them on their first meeting...!" Though she had just come into existence, Artemis' head was filled with a wealth of knowledge and information, provided to her by the various Divinities taking root within her soul. She even had memories of Zeus himself, tearing a body she could no longer visualize within her mind to pieces as unbridled rage fought alongside the pain flowing into her neck.</p><p>Suddenly, the massive blue moon that had formed in the sky shot forth with an arrow that barreled towards Zeus with unstoppable force. His eyes widened as the amount of electricity around his body more than doubled, distorting space until it looked as though his body was bent into a C-shape. The arrow missed him but the ambient energy tore away at his Arcanum while Artemis herself was empowered, dawning her raiment for the first time as massive magic circles formed around her body. These formations sent forth several phantom images of animals, assaulting towards Zeus with ravenous intentions as the angered god created whips of lightning that tore hundreds asunder with each blow.</p><p>Hachiman, a mountain of a god that stood more than 300cm tall, body primming with phenomenal might as his muscles glistened under the ambient light of Heaven, took advantage of the sudden conflict between Zeus and Artemis to attack. He hefted a massive black staff that was adorned with a golden loop on the end, possessing nine rings that radiated divine light. Against expectations, he pulled at the air, causing the staff to bend as a line of energy formed into a string, giving the staff the appearance of a bow that now held a pure golden arrow. The moment Zeus had to dodge an 8m tall tiger, Hachiman loosed the arrow and sent it on a direct path towards Zeus' forehead.</p><p>At this point, distracted by the horde of animals attacking him, Zeus was unable to react in time to evade Hachiman's arrow. Fortunately, Poseidon had noticed the attack and managed to intercept the seemingly unstoppable arrow with an ornate golden trident, shouting, "Cowardice! Using sneak attacks when you already have a numerical advantage...is this the so-called pride of the Eastern Gods!?" Without waiting for their response, Poseidon brandished his trident towards Artemis, sending an ocean of Arcanum infused waves to wash away the animals as he exclaimed, "You are obviously of the Northern Pantheon; do not interfere with this fight if you will not aid your fellow gods!"</p><p>Because the style of raiment varied greatly amongst the different Pantheons, it was relatively easy to determine the origin of another god. Artemis also knew she was of the Northern Pantheon but, instead of backing down, furrowed her brows deeply as she ascended into the sky, exclaiming, "That cur wished to tarnish my body at his leisure, without even given me the freedom of a real choice! You asked for my name, Zeus, then I shall tell you...I am Artemis, Goddess of the Hunt, Goddess of the Moon, Goddess of the Wild, and..." At this point, a moon-shaped magic formation that was several kilometers across had formed behind Artemis as she shouted, "Goddess of Chastity...!"</p><p>With a much greater force than even Hachiman's arrow, Artemis' descended upon Zeus like a moonbeam, traveling much faster than the eye could follow. Zeus' body distorted just before the arrow struck, causing his body to appear several hundred meters away as a massive hole was torn through the very fabric of Heaven. Chaotic energy began to spill out from the gaping void Artemis' arrow had created, alerting the other five gods present and bringing an end to their conflict as they were actually forced to seal the hole together. From that point on, Artemis' arrow became one of the most famous weapons in all of Heaven, making her a force many wanted to win over, but few were able to get close to...</p><p>Because of her experience with Zeus, Artemis didn't trust any male gods and, as even goddesses were embroiled in conflict at the time, she became something of a loner. Other than the animal companions she could summon to her side, Artemis spent the majority of her time within the 'Spirit Wilds', a massive expanse of forest where even normal trees seemed to be formed of precious gemstones. She felt far more comfortable among the unformed Spirits, some of which would temporarily fuse together with her animal companions for a few hundred thousand years...</p><p>Eventually, the conflicts within Heaven started to calm down, though Artemis wasn't sure how much time had passed before Apollo, a god who had come into existence shortly after her, delivered unexpected news. Though Zeus had been unable to overthrow Ouranos and become the ruler of the Northern Pantheon, the Elder God had bestowed him the title of Olympian for his exploits. Zeus used this as an opportunity to elevate himself by bestowing a similar title upon those he deemed worthy. Since he had realized Ouranos wasn't actively controlling the North Pantheon, Zeus wished that the gods he selected would represent the Northen Pantheon and rule over future generations of gods...</p><p>Apollo, who had been given the 7th seat, had come to inform Artemis that she had been selected at the 8th Olympian. Though she had no interest in the title at all, Apollo also carried news that Zeus promised to never interfere with her life if she accepted the seat. Since she wanted to avoid having her peaceful life ruined by the egotistical god's intervention, Artemis reluctantly accepted the offer and showed up at the massive palatial structure that dominated the horizon. This was the central structure that represented the North Pantheon, currently known as the Sky Palace but soon to be known as Mount Olympus...</p><p>Upon arriving within the Palace, Artemis met her fellow Olympian's for the first time, including Zeus himself. At his side, clinging to his arm like an extension of the arrogant man's body, was the Goddess of Marriage, Hera. Standing at the side, wearing ornamental robes that flowed around his body like torrential waves, was Poseidon, a perpetually stern expression on his face. The other Olympians included gods Artemis had never met before, introduced as Demeter, Athena, Ares, Hermes, Aphrodite, Hades, and, almost immediately catching her attention, a diminutive goddess named Hestia.</p><p>Hestia was unlike all of the other gods Artemis had met, each seeming self-assured in their individuality and having strong characters. Compared to them, Hestia was a very quiet and gentle looking woman, even though the aura surrounding her body dwarfed almost everyone else within the room. After the gathering had completed, Artemis sought out Hestia, eager to learn more about the strange goddess who, similar to herself, seemingly had no desire to be an Olympian. It was during this meeting that Artemis first sat with Hestia atop an ancient temple that seemed much older than almost any other structure in Heaven. Here, next to this warm and sacred fire, Artemis found companionship in another god for the first time...</p><p>Though she did not visit that often, Artemis always found herself arriving at Hestia's Divine Hearth whenever her heart was troubled. She very quickly learned that other gods also went to Hestia, finding peace and acceptance in her small temple, even though Hestia rarely said anything. Most of the time, she simply listened to the troubles of others and, if it was suitable for her to do so, offered them kind advice that felt like it could heal the soul. Strangely, those that were 'too proud' to seek this same comfort began to bad mouth Hestia, especially after she stepped down from her position as an Olympian, giving it up to a rather young god named Dionysus.</p><p>When Artemis asked why Hestia did something so troublesome, especially with how people treated her within the godly community, Hestia simply smiled and said, "I was only ever made an Olympian because Zeus had intended for there to be an even split between men and women. He believed that we virgin goddesses may one day relent, seeking companionship in our fellow Olympians and becoming couples that would owe our happiness to him. I don't believe he ever expected three of his Olympians to remain virgin goddesses for so long...besides, Dionysus, that troubled child, seemed to really want to be an Olympian...I could not stand to see him continue hurting himself in an effort to elevate his status...if I can avoid another conflict by giving up my seat, that is for the best..."</p><p>Hestia was always like this, being better to other gods than she was to her own self, even if the entire godly community ridiculed her as a 'Lazy Goddess'. Artemis found it ridiculous that her kindness was held in contempt, even though the majority of gods acted like fools who squabbled over the pettiest of issues. They were a bunch of licentious and egotistical despots who eagerly sought to receive benefits from others with the least possible amount of effort at their expense. There were even gods who would come to the Spirit Woods, trying to coax her into a 'fling' out of nothing more than curiosity and 'bragging' rights. Artemis had heard so many flowery words said with the intention to manipulate and exploit her that she now greeted most gods with a flurry of arrows instead of words...</p><p>Unable to change Hestia's nature, or perhaps unwilling to as she was more reliant on Hestia's kindness than she'd admit, Artemis continued her eternity among the animals and spirits. Eventually, she also became relatively close with Athena, the third of the 'three virgin goddesses' and they were able to confide in each other within Hestia's Hearth. Then, bringing about a great change to the power structure of the Northern Pantheon, a goddess named Hephaestus had come into existence. Her creations were so prodigious that all eight regions of Heaven had taken note of her, leading Zeus to confront Hades and remove him as an Olympian, once again 'balancing' the gender ratio of his little group...</p><p>Because of her deformity, Hephaestus was shunned by many gods and, as a result of her loneliness, she became close friends with Hestia. Artemis met her several times and, learning that Hephaestus' character was commendable, they too became rather close. It was a tragedy that Hephaestus was actually a very beautiful woman but had been afflicted with a curse, rumored to have been bestowed upon her by the collective envy of every other forging god. Since she was able to create artifacts that could put to shame the creations of all other gods, many considered it 'fair' that she wore a perpetual blemish on her face...a permanant reminder that, even if her creations seemed perfect, they were the production of a 'flawed' goddess...</p><p>Eons passed and, slowly but surely, changes occurred in Heaven, this time resulting from the emergence of sentient creatures within the mortal world. This had brought most ongoing conflicts to a halt as everyone, including Artemis herself, was watching over the mortal world with intrigue. She became fond of the budding hunters and explorers, granting them her blessing so they could safely navigate the forests and walk amongst the animals. Though some hated them, Artemis became very fond of the Beast People that resulted in the unity between their 'children', the Spirits, and humans. The fact that many surface races ostracized them made Artemis feel a kinship towards these people and, after hundreds of years of careful guidance, Artemis helped to select champions that would help to unite their people in one massive tribe...</p><p>Eventually, though Heaven was still divided into eight sections, the borders between the regions were almost inconsequential. Most gods freely roamed Heaven, making partnerships with other gods as they interfered with mortal affairs and treated the lower world as a game. Some even had the idea of trying to directly descend, attempting to possess the bodies of High Spirits to serve as their vessels. These first attempts actually had unexpected consequences, chief amongst them being the strengthening of the 'barrier' between the two worlds. Gods lost the ability to directly influence the mortal world and they went to the surviving Elder Gods, pestering them until a solution was found...</p><p>Using powers that dwarfed anything remotely attainable by younger gods, Ouranos assisted in the creation of a 'bridge' between Heaven and the Mortal World, using the very same bridge that connected the three realms together. To cross into the Mortal World, it was necessary to form an Avatar that could pass through the barrier separating the worlds. This was a simple feat for most gods so, after sealing their Divine Bodies, many curious and perpetually bored gods descended to the mortal world alongside Ouranos. Most of the Olympians also made this journey and, wanting to experience life alongside those she felt a kinship with, Artemis bid farewell to Hestia and descended to the mortal world after things had stabilized a bit...</p><p>Before descending to the mortal world, Artemis convinced Hermes to escort her away from the main pathway and deposit her on the Dark Continent. She didn't enjoy the politics of the Continent known as Eden and preferred to live alongside the Beast People who worshipped her as one of their patron goddesses. For a time, Artemis enjoyed life as one of the most powerful and influential gods on the Dark Continent, creating a temple with hundreds of female huntresses maintaining her shrine. Unfortunately, as a result of the greedy and whimsical nature of mortals, gathering so many people in one place, especially on the Dark Continent, drew a lot of attention. Artemis' temple was destroyed and, of the more than six-hundred maidens within her shrine, over half had been murdered while the others became 'war spoils', enslaved and raped by their would-be conquerers...</p><p>Enraged by this injustice, Artemis activated her Arcanum in the mortal world and, as a result, a crescent-shaped coast now existed where solid land used to be. Artemis not only slaughtered the people who had defiled her followers, but her defiled followers themselves, praying their souls would be washed and purified before they reincarnated anew. She spent the fifty years after that almost entirely within Hestia's Divine Hearth, becoming much closer with the diminutive goddess and trying to defend her image within the godly community. When her avatar had reformed, Artemis once again descended, this time deciding that her Familia would be much smaller and, instead of staying in one place and becoming complacent, they would be a group of wanderers that would help others that needed their assistance...</p><p>Unlike how she took a backseat role during her previous descent, Artemis was now much more proactive with her Familia. She specifically sought out girls who seemed to have great potential and relatively pure souls. After bestowing her blessing upon them, Artemis would train them as Huntresses as they went around eliminating dangerous beasts and protecting the small villages dotting the Dark Continent. Though it wasn't as extreme as her first time in the mortal world, Artemis' Familia slowly grew until they had nearly twenty people, each her beloved and cherished children...</p><p>While traveling around and helping people, Artemis noticed that several of her children would fall in love with men they ended up saving. She didn't understand how the girls could fall in love so easily but, not wanting to restrict their happiness, Artemis would allow them to leave the Familia if they wanted to seek love. Curiously, the majority of the girls chose to stay within the Familia and Artemis began to appreciate them even more. Though some of them acted very strangely toward her, helping to wash her back and sometimes snuggling up in the same tent, Artemis found their companionship very comforting...</p><p>One day, one of her relatively new Familia members, a Chienthrope woman named Lante, ended up causing a scene by confessing that she had fallen in love with a man after their hands brushed accidentally. Artemis found this claim rather amusing and, though she had intended it to be a jest, told Lante that she should leave the Familia if she desired male companionship so dearly that a simple touch was enough to set her off. Surprisingly, Lante defended herself rather proactively and went on a long diatribe about the power of love and its ability to change everything, even fate. Artemis found her words strangely compelling, deciding to ask the others within her Familia what they thought about love. To her surprise, causing Artemis to fall into deep reflection, all twentyof her members purported that love wasn't just important, but perhaps the 'most important' thing to experience in life...</p><p>For quite a while after that confrontation, Artemis brooded over her Familia's words and tried to reflect upon their meaning. She realized there was a fair amount of truth contained within their claims, as the emotions she felt towards goddesses like Hestia and Hephaestus were akin to love. Without the compassion and understanding they had shown her, Artemis wasn't confident she could have tolerated the loneliness of existence with just the spirits. She also realized that even her bond with the animal companions she kept was another form of love, just that she had never treated it in that fashion...</p><p>Since her children were very loyal to her, choosing to stay within the Familia instead of seeking out love, Artemis began to wonder if she needed to change her ways. She started to harbor thoughts that love might be one of the things she had been missing throughout her long existence and, remembering Hestia's words about family, Artemis began wondering what it would be like to have her own, at least for a short while. However, as if some form of divine objection to these thoughts, Artemis noticed that a powerful aura began to rise up from the end of the Continent. Since she had watched the conflict against Antares in the past, Artemis believed its seal could be weakening and used an oracle to contact the Guild to request assistance in an investigation...</p><p>Hermes, one of the people she truly didn't want to see with her conflicted state of mind, ended up being the one to show up. Artemis felt like he could see through her thoughts and she became very defensive about everything he said, each word grating against her patience. She wanted to end the investigation as quickly as possible so he would leave, taking her entire Familia along to Elsos Ruins to expedite the process. Things were going relatively smoothly and, after only a few hours of searching, they found a massive scorpion-like monster sealed away within the heart of the ruins. Fortunately, the seal seemed to still be in place so Artemis commanded her Familia to prepare for a ritual that would allow them to strengthen the seal until a more permanant solution could be found.</p><p>Once everything was set up, Artemis stepped forward to recite a long incantation in the language of the gods, her entire Familia watching with intrigue. However, at the very moment she opened her mouth to speak the first word, Artemis heard a scream from Rethusa, the Captain of her Familia, and opened her eyes to see the massive maw of Antares closing around her. She tried to activate her Arcanum out of instinct but, before she could command the power, her Arcanum crystallized and formed a prison around her avatar, one which was directly linked with the Antares' magic core.</p><p>Panic set in Artemis' mind as she tried to muster up as much power as possible, only serving to strength Antares further as it began slaughtering her Familia. Unable to move, Artemis could only scream out in her mind while tears pooled at her face, watching as each member of her Familia was brutally murdered by the monster...using the very power she mustered to try and protect them. In less than a minute, the only two members of her Familia were brave and love-sick Lante and her uncharacteristically terrified Captain, Rethusa. The latter ran for the doors, now barred by crystallized black tendrils, while Lante ran forward and cried out, trying to rescue Artemis from the Antares' grasp.</p><p>Artemis wanted to cry out, telling Lante to run, but her voice was trapped within her immobile body as Antares impaled the young Chienthrope through the abdomen. Even so, Lante didn't immediately die, tears running down her face as blood pooled at the edge of her lips, muttering, "Artemis-sama...I...love..." Before she was able to finish her words, Lante's eyes darkened as the life faded from the body. However, falling out from her clenched hand, there was a dark-red magic core that began to radiate with a vibrant light. Lante had a rare skill that allowed her to destabilize the mana within magic cores, using them as powerful explosives.</p><p>The magic core exploded, fracturing the crystallized Arcanum just enough for Artemis to fragment a piece of her Arcanum, forming a single arrow that embedded itself into the wall. Almost immediately thereafter, Hermes appeared, grabbing the arrow with a solemn and pained expression. Artemis used the remnants of her consciousness to send him a message, asking him to seek out someone pure-hearted to carry the burden of slaying her with the arrow. Without waiting for a response, she converged as much of her power as she was able, trying to seal it away so Antares couldn't use it to wreak havoc anymore. The last thing she heard was the roar of Antares, the scream of Rethusa, and the muted sobs of her own soul crying out at the loss of her children...</p><p>(A/N: This chapter was a doozey so I decided to take a break after it was written. Next chapter would have been a massive cliff so I will probably release 6 tomorrow, unless some of the chapters get long. This one was over 4k words and I needed a break after writing so many heartbreaking things T_T...)</p><p>(A/N: Alternate Titles: 'Zeus, egotistical scum from the start...','Hestia is Bestia...','Oh no...')</p><p>https://bit.ly/2XBzAYu &lt;-(p.atreon link)</p><p>paypal.me/Einlion</p><p>Discord Invite: https://discord.gg/mn5xMbE</p></main><div class="link-group"><a class="btn" href="00855.html">Previous</a><a class="btn" href="00857.html">Next</a></div></div><div id="readpos">0%</div></body></html>
