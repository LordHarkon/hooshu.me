<p>With the Vice-Director of the Policies Department giving way, there was no one with the authority to prevent Luvia from guiding Vahn into the very heart of the Clock Tower. Though any of the various Lords would be able to stall her for a short while, they had no grounds to stand on and, depending on the circumstances, this could quickly come back to bite them since it was rarely worth making an enemy out of the Edelfelts. Not only did they have the financial clout to put pressure on the majority of families, including a few of the top ten, but they also had one of the most powerful military forces amongst Magus families.</p><p>As the vast majority consolidated power internally, cultivating a few key Magi to represent their authority, only the three most prestigious families had the ability to contend against the Edelfelt's military might directly. Thus, even people like Lord Sophia-Ri could only grind their teeth as Luvia led Vahn to their destination, the entrance to Magi's Fair, the mining city that served as the exchange hub for all missions and materials related to the Spiritual Tomb Albion. Though the Director was rumored to have their own Bounded Field within the Elizabeth Tower, the massive spire commoners referred to as 'Big Ben', most of the Administrative offices were located at the entrance and near the bottom level of the Spiritual Tomb.</p><p>Not unexpectedly, more than ten official Enforcers were awaiting them while, at the very front of the group, a man Vahn had been looking forward to meeting towered over nearly everyone else present, at least insofar as his aura was concerned. In truth, he was the same height as Vahn, 185cm, but he gave off a presence similar to an insurmountable mountain, even though he was supporting himself with an ornate cane and appeared to be nothing more than an old man at a glance. Even without Luvia having to explain who he was, Vahn adopted a smile that didn't quite reach his eyes, plainly stating, "Kischur Zelretch Schweinorg, the wielder of the Second Magic, Kaleidoscope..."</p><p>Without missing a beat, almost as if their meeting had been rehearsed, Zelretch returned a wry smile of his own, his elderly voice echoing with a deep baritone hum as he stated, "Vahn Aldrnari Mason, the Sage Emperor from another world...I was wondering when we would finally meet. Now that I have seen you in person...you are quite the monster, aren't you...?" Though the last few words were said in a somewhat humorous tone, Vahn didn't miss the momentary battle lust that had flashed across Zelretch's ruby-red pupils. He may have had the appearance of a man in his seventies but, as if age only gave him more power, Zelretch gave off an unfathomable aura. The more Vahn tried to sense, the deeper the wellspring of his power seemed to become, almost as if he were gazing into an infinite mass of mana...</p><p>With his smile curling up at the ends, Vahn could feel his tensions rising as he mused, "That is rather humorous, coming from someone like you..." Others may not be able to sense it but, regardless of how Zelretch tried to conceal it, Vahn could tell that he was a Vampire, one far above other Dead Apostle Ancestors. He had never felt Eva's true power, as he only ever interacted with her memory fragment, but Vahn imagined she would give off a similar aura to the one concealed inside Zelretch's body. This meant that, not only did he possess a seemingly infinite amount of mana, but he was also an immortal that would be able to regenerate from virtually any wound. With the ability to transition through tangential timelines, Vahn knew he would be a nightmare opponent to do battle against, even though he had a strange urge to give it a go...</p><p>While Vahn sensed his own limitless mana reserves, Zelretch could sense 'something' concealed within the former's body, giving a very similar impression. Though Vahn seemed weak at a glance, his instincts that had been honed over millennia told him that defeating the man before him may very well take more than he could give. Even when he had faced against Brunestud of the Crimson Moon, Zelretch never had the impression that he would be unable to defeat his opponent. Now that he stood face to face with Vahn, however, his instincts were telling him that he would need to make ample preparations for any conflict between them. He had an unfathomable aura and, even though his eyes allowed him to see the true nature of all things, Zelretch was slightly shocked that Vahn was an enigma within his eyes...</p><p>As the two continued to stare at each other in silence, the tension in the atmosphere continued to build, eventually reaching the point that some of the Enforcers began to fidget nervously. Though Vahn and Zelretch weren't releasing their Magical Energy at all, just their 'presence' alone made those gathered around them feel small and inconsequential in comparison. It was like watching two Gods face down each other while they, mere mortals, could only stand at the side, praying that they would not be victims if the two were to clash.</p><p>Fortunately, as neither Vahn nor Zelretch were really the types to arbitrarily perpetuate destruction, they only observed each other for a few minutes before the latter smiled in an amused manner as he asked, "Tell me, Sage Emperor, what is the purpose of your visit? As you are in the company of Lady Edelfelt, I imagine you are already aware of your status within the Mage's Association. I find it hard to believe someone of your status would turn themselves over so I can only assume you have come seeking a dialogue...?" Even if it was rather obvious, Zelretch had somewhat similar intentions to Luvia, making it an 'open' matter by discussing the subject of Vahn's visit in earshot of others. With the fate of the world on the line, he would not arbitrarily make an enemy out of a man he couldn't fathom, even with all his combined experience.</p><p>Feeling that Zelretch wasn't an evil person, as his mana was actually extremely pure, regardless of the fact he was a Dead Apostle Ancestor, Vahn's expression softened a bit as he nodded his head and answered, "That is, indeed, the case. There are several misunderstandings I would like to clear up and, as we may very well be allies in the coming conflict, I believe it would be senseless to engage each other as enemies at this time. Though I may not see eye-to-eye with the Mage's Association, it is not my intention to seek trouble while the fate of the world hangs in the balance. I'm certain we can come to an accord through dialogue and, though I have no intention of becoming a part of the Mage's Association, I believe we can work together toward a common goal."</p><p>Vahn made no effort to conceal that he wasn't on the side of the Mage's Association, even if he was going to cooperate with them in the future. As he would be establishing his own faction, he decided a bit of transparency was in order, even if it would make things marginally more difficult later on. If they tried seeking trouble with him, Vahn wanted it to be made very clear that he was not part of their hierarchal structure and, depending on the circumstances, it would be their actions that caused conflicts to break out.</p><p>If others had said something similar, Zelretch would have considered them foolish, especially if they uttered such words in the heart of the Mage's Association. When Vahn said them, however, there was a certain weight behind the words that made them hard to rebuff outright. His intuition told him that, if things went south, the entire Clock Tower could be razed in the resulting conflict. With that in mind, Zelretch gave a solemn nod before gesturing to the Executors and saying, "Until further notice, the Sealing Designation on the Sage Emperor has been revoked. Return to your duties and see to it that others do not cause trouble while I escort him to meet with the Association Director..." As he spoke about others causing trouble, Zelretch gave an unamused look towards Luvia, causing her to elegantly chuckle in response...</p><p>While the Executors were dispersing, though very few wandered too far, Vahn and Luvia shared a few parting words before he gave Gray's head a comforting rub. Then, with the two going off to make preparations for a potential conflict, Vahn fell into step alongside Zelretch while Artoria followed a few steps behind. As he had once stepped back in time to view the conflicts between King Arthur and the Saxons, Zelretch was very aware of her identity. It was actually her presence at Vahn's side, even more so than Luvia, that caused him to lower his guard slightly. Though he may not be able to see through Vahn, it was clear that Artoria and Luvia were not under any kind of influence. Thus, at least for the time being, Zelretch decided to give Vahn the benefit of the doubt, even if he knew that Solon would probably lambast him for it.</p><p>After passing through a complex network of tunnels, Zelretch began guiding Vahn and Artoria toward the surface once again, beneath the location that Vahn had identified as the Elizabeth Tower. It would seem that the rumors regarding the Association Director's private residence were not false as, after activating a circular elevator platform, the surroundings rapidly began to change, expanding to a size much larger than the dimensions of the tower itself. Since they had been walking in silence for quite a while, Zelretch used this as an opportunity to start a conversation, explaining, "Around two-hundred years ago, the Director asked me to use the Second Magic to expand the interior of the Clock Tower. You probably noticed it yourself but, compared to the outside world, even the halls are more than twice the size they otherwise should be. As for this tower itself, space continues to expand the further you go, eventually reaching the size of a small world..."</p><p>Hearing the pride contained within Zelretch's tone, Vahn adopted an amused smile, complimenting, "It really is quite something. I would normally need to use a powerful catalyst and spend a few hours to create a world this size. The fact that you are able to achieve such a feat using your own power is quite something..." Since the Space-Time Orbs could be theoretically infinite in size, needing only a greater volume of mana to expand without limit, Vahn decided to tease the prideful old man a bit. His words seemed to have quite an impact on Zelretch, causing him to raise his brows in an almost comical manner as he asked, "Do you have the Imaginary Numbers element...?" As there was no way Vahn could use the Second Magic without his notice, Zelretch didn't even imagine for a moment that he was able to manipulate Space as easily as he seemed intent to have him believe.</p><p>Shaking his head in response to Zelretch's question, while simultaneously wondering just how far this elevator was going to take them, Vahn answered, "There are a great many misunderstandings the Magi of this world have in regards to Thaumaturgy, Mystery, and Magic. I plan to help rectify some of these misunderstandings, in time, but that kind of discussion will have to wait until later. The only thing you need to know is that, while stealing power from the Root is certainly convenient, there are other ways to gain access to such powers..." Since Zelretch was one of his targets, at least the 'original' Zelretch, Vahn knew the old man would understand what he meant when mentioning how he 'stole' power from the Root.</p><p>No longer amused, Zelretch's eyes became razor-sharp as he asked, "What do you know about the Root? What are you really...?" Though he did not become outright hostile against Vahn, Zelretch was very aware of what he meant with his words. It was a truth that he had never told others but, while he had memories of reaching the Root, Zelretch himself had never actually trespassed that inviolable space. It was another version of him who had achieved the feat but, at that same instant, he, and every other Zelretch in the vast and infinite multiverse, all gained access to the Second Magic. From that moment onward, they had an intuitive knowledge of how to use it and, almost like a hive mind, they had continued to observe the variable timelines in an effort to guide others toward the Root and prevent the World's destruction...</p><p>Though it was a very dangerous statement to make, Vahn turned to face Zelretch directly, his own eyes blazing with a subtle hint of Divinity as he stated, "I know what is on the 'outside' that your original was too ignorant or afraid to face..." This one statement was like a bomb within Zelretch's mind as there was only one thing Magi meant when talking about the 'outisde' in relation to the Root. His eyes widened in abject shock as, if Vahn's words were the truth, it meant his existence was far more significant than they had ever assumed. At the same time, the reason why Vahn appeared to be a 'singularity' within the time axis suddenly made a lot of sense. If he was from the 'outside', the fundamental nature of his existence was drastically different than anything born 'inside' of the Root...</p><p>As it was impossible to ascertain if Vahn's words were the truth, at least without concrete proof, Zelretch maintained a healthy skepticism, even though he elevated Vahn's status considerably. If his status as the 'Sage Emperor' was legitimate, while also being from the 'Outside', the ramifications for any slights against him would be extreme. At the same time, it meant his knowledge pertaining to True Magic was likely far greater than the current understanding of anyone within the Root. With this being the presumed truth, the question then became a matter of 'why' Vahn had come back. If he was truly from the 'outside', that meant there had to be a reason for him to enter into the Root and descend into this particular world...</p><p>Seeing Zelretch's reaction, Vahn shook his head lightly before plainly stating, "You need not worry. I do have a reason for entering into the Root but it is not anything malicious. In truth, I'm only passing through en route to a completely different destination than the worlds within. I may have business with your original but it isn't to the extent that we would become enemies...now, exactly how long is this elevator ride going to take? Do you enjoy wasting my time...?" As Vahn had already noticed that Zelretch had created a spatial loop, even if it had taken him a bit of time, he was now looking toward the elderly man with a slightly annoyed look flashing across his eyes.</p><p>Though he was still uncertain about the veracity of Vahn's words, Zelretch felt that he shouldn't be a bad person. It was rather unnerving to imagine his words were the truth but, if this did indeed turn out to be the case, a revolution within the Magus community was afoot. The problem was, even with the threat of the world's destruction looming over them, the current status quo wasn't prepared for any drastic changes. For the last few decades, largely as a result of the Holy Grail Wars in Fuyuki, things had been rather tense between the Mage's Association and the Holy Church. At the same time, even though the Clock Tower was considered the heart of the Association, the other two primary branches were more or less cut off from the rest of the Magus Community.</p><p>Ever since the Clock Tower become the official Headquarters, the Atlas Temple would not even accept a visit from the Director while the Wandering Sea still maintained their isolationist practices, focusing solely on the study of Magecraft related to the Age of Gods. Though the current Director, Solon, had actually hailed from the Wandering Sea, they fundamentally lacked the power and authority to force the old monsters slumbering there to obey. The only reason the Clock Tower became the official Headquarters was due to the fact that the other two branches simply didn't care about the global Magus community...</p><p>Feeling a headache coming along, Zelretch released a sigh before smiling in response to Vahn's complaint, answering, "It is just a small prank. When you have lived as long as I, finding ways to amuse oneself is the only method to avoid becoming senile..." Though Vahn struck him as a man who was older than he appeared, Zelretch had the distinct impression he shouldn't be more than a few hundred years old. It was this impression that made it hard to believe he was from the 'outside' as, even though he had absolutely no idea what the world on the other side of the Root was like, it didn't seem like a place where a 'relatively' normal person would come from.</p><p>Hearing Zelretch's somewhat grating laughter, Vahn just shook his head and decided to ignore the old man's prank. At the very least, he was able to see how the Second Magic was used and, while it would take him quite a long time to comprehend, just seeing how the space was bent according to Zelretch's will was quite educational. When he was able to use his Qinglong form freely in the future, Vahn intended to seek out the old man for advice, finding that he was strangely agreeable, even if a little strange. Since it wouldn't be that difficult for Zelretch to try and lock him away in a sealed-off spatial dimension, yet chose not to, Vahn felt he wasn't an enemy, at least for the time being...</p><p>With Zelretch breaking the loop, it wasn't long before the elevator finally reached its highest point, filling in a circular hole on a massive disc-shaped platform. Rather than the walls of a tower, there were clear blue skies as far as the eye could see, populated by a few wispy white clouds. In the far distance, Vahn could even make out the figure of what appeared to by flying Wyverns, indicating this 'world' was distinctly different than the sub-texture that the Clock Tower occupied. What he found most curious was that, at the edge of the circular platform, there was a set of stairs that extended out into the void, completely lacking supports. They led up to a massive temple that, like the stairs and platform, seemed to be floating in the sky with unshakeable stability.</p><p>Like before, Zelretch took it upon himself to explain once again, this time with the intention of trying to build rapport with Vahn as he stated, "This place is similar to a false Reality Marble, given form by various treasures and the Second Magic. The landscape you see around you represents the Reverse Side of the World and, though you could travel out endlessly, you will find that it is quite impossible to reach any of the scenery or interact with any of the creatures. In more ways than one, this place represents the obsession of something that cannot be obtained, only glimpsed..."</p><p>Though there were numerous access points that the Mage's Association could use to reach the Reverse Side of the World, entering arbitrarily was extremely foolish. Even for existences such as Solon and himself, who had both walked the earth during the Age of Gods, it would be a death sentence to remain there in a physical body. Solon had tried several methods to rectify this, to the point that they had become something far removed from humanity, but this had all changed in the mid 18th century.
