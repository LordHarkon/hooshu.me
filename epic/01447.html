<p>Though a far cry from her peak capabilities, Atalanta still had A-Rank Agility, allowing her to cover vast distances in an exceptionally short period of time. She moved swifter than the wind, leaving few traces of her existence as she zipped passed various Attack Programs, the majority of which didn't even react to her presence. Only those with flight capabilities, or those designed with speed in mind, were able to trace her path. By the time they shifted from a neutral blue to a vibrant red, however, they already had arrows sticking out of their bodies, followed by small explosions that either killed or disabled them.</p><p>Atalanta had always been skilled at hunting on the move, an ability that had allowed her original self to hunt down the legendary Calydonian Boar, a Phantasmal Beast created by Artemis to lay waste to the Calydonian region. She had been the only one capable of wounding the creature, a combination of Artemis' blessing, her reputed speed, and her ability to manipulate the wind to guide her arrows to their target. As a result, she drew first blood against the beast, allowing other Heroes to eventually deal a fatal blow, saving all of Greece in the process.</p><p>Now, as a result of the skills her original self had polished, Atalanta moved with impunity through the Photonic Abyss, bypassing a startling amount of foes along the way. She only began to slow after seeing a massive, plesiosaur-like Attack Program in the distance, its length more than 30m. It was also capable of swimming through the air, floating several hundred meters above the ground as it bombarded the terrain with massive, reddish-black, lasers.</p><p>Hunting large game always got her excited so Atlanta wasted no time in drawing her bow, shaping Wind Elemental energy into three vibrant green arrows. Before she was able to loose them upon the massive creature, however, she sensed a strange fluctuation that made her hair stand on end. In the next moment, the 30m long Attack Program was bisected in two, its individual halves slowly sliding away from each other before ultimately exploding seconds later...</p><p>Atalanta had already assumed the people engaging the creature were her quarry, so, rather than let the monster's death bother her, she quickly made her way over to the site of the battle, finding three women and one man spread out over the uneven terrain. They, or at least the man, also noticed her, his pale-gold eyes glimmering with a subtle silver light as he calmly stared back at her.</p><p>Though generally not fond of men, for a variety of reasons, Atalanta didn't get the same impression as usual when seeing the white-haired man before her. He reminded her a lot of Paris, a delicate boy with a gentle nature. Unlike Paris, however, the man before her gave off the impression of someone that had born heavy burdens, much like a soldier that had spent an inordinate amount of time upon the battlefield.</p><p>While she was somewhat interested in the man's story, Atalanta ultimately decided to simply ignore him, turning her eyes upon the muscular woman with horse-like ears, surprising the latter by asking, "Are you Caenis?"</p><p>Due to the nature of Atalanta's existence, Caenis hadn't even noticed the feline woman 'sneaking' up from behind her, causing her ears to perk up in surprise as she spun around, spear brandished as she shouted, "Who are you!?" in a higher pitch than normal.</p><p>Having dashed back more than a hundred meters by the time Caenis had turned around, Atalanta just ran her fingers through her hair, answering in a dull tone, "I am Atalanta. Based on your features, you must be Caenis, correct?"</p><p>Hearing Atalanta's introduction, realization donned on Caenis, followed by her spear lowering as she offered a rare smile and answered, "I remember you now...yes, you are that little brat that ran around with the Argonauts back in the day. Did Jason send you to guide us?"</p><p>Though Caenis didn't get along with most people, those like Atalanta were the exception. Not only was she a woman worthy of respect, but, much like herself, Atalanta had suffered greatly as a result of both men and God alike. She knew the original Atalanta for a brief moment, and, though they had only exchanged a few words, Caenis had come to empathize with the woman's plight. As for why she hadn't recognized the famous huntress, it was due to the fact that nearly sixteen hundred years had passed since their last meeting. Back then, Atalanta also had a relatively 'normal' appearance, bereft of the feline traits she currently possessed...</p><p>Sensing no hostility from Caenis, Atalanta's grip on her bow loosened slightly, followed by a slight shaking of her head as she answered, "Not exactly...? I was sent to ascertain whether or not you had malicious intentions. That coward got spooked by your killing intent and has been panicking ever since."</p><p>Hearing Atalanta refer to Jason as a coward, Caenis couldn't help but release a loud laugh as she shouldered her spear and said, "That pansy would be started by his own shadow if he saw it in the middle of the night. Though I wouldn't mind leaving that man to rot on a pike, I'm not going to kill him for no reason..."</p><p>Though she wasn't exactly lying, even Caenis didn't quite believe her own words, causing Atalanta to frown slightly. Fortunately, Shirou had approached, leaving Musashi and Altria to finish off what few enemies remained. The Photonic Abyss seemed to produce a functionally infinite amount of Attack Programs, but, so long as you cleared out an area, they wouldn't respawn in the same location. Thus, by clearing out an area, you could give yourself some breathing room by establishing and growing a territory.</p><p>Ignoring the glare Caenis sent his way, Shirou held up his hands in a disarming manner as he stated, "My name is Shirou...Shirou Emiya. We have come with the intent to share information. Many things have changed in the last few hours. Before Jason ends up doing something that causes trouble for everyone, we wanted to meet with him and explain the new situation. Tell him that he doesn't need to worry. Unless he starts a fight, none of us have the intention of trying to harm him..."</p><p>Though she didn't sense any falsehood in Shirou's words, Atalanta got the distinct impression that, if it came down to it, the pale-haired man wouldn't hesitate to kill Jason. This was a problem, as, while she cared 'very' little about the arrogant man, she didn't want to just vanish into thin air. At the very least, it was strangely comfortable staying inside the mysterious abyss every Argonaut existed within prior to being summoned, so, if possible, she wanted to avoid Jason's death.</p><p>Shirou could tell his words hadn't been able to convince Atalanta, causing his smile to turn wry as he lowered his hands and added, "It's fine if you just pass on the information to him. If he just chooses to stay put, we don't have any pressing need to interfere in his life. Ultimately, the person he needs to worry about is the Sage Dragon Emperor. The latter has only given us forty-eight hours to reach a consensus. If Jason is unwilling to compromise...there is a good chance he will die a very painful and gruesome death..."</p><p>Compared to before, Atalanta could hear the sincerity in Shirou's words, despite their gravitas. This made it seem like there was no room for discussion, implying that death was an absolute, impossible to avoid, outcome.</p><p>With her own existence threatened, Atalanta showed a resolute expression, saying, "Tell me. I will do my best to convince him. That man is a coward who prioritizes his own survival over everything else. If he can be convinced that his death is a certainty, he should be willing to compromise..."</p><p>Shirou didn't harbor much hope that Jason would actually acquiesce to the Empire's Common Law, but, as it would be unnecessarily cruel to leave him in the dark, he still explained the situation from start to finish. This left Atalanta slightly pale, her expression showing clear disbelief as it was hard to imagine someone as powerful as Shirou described. If not for the presence of Musashi, one who had easily cut down a veritable army of enemies, she wouldn't have been able to believe it...</p><p>---</p><p>Around the same time that Shirou was convincing Atalanta, Vahn found himself face-to-face with a woman possessing many shared features with his Shishou. It could almost be said they were twins, if not for the fact one had deep purple hair while the other's was closer to vermillion. Even their outfits were similar, with Aife wearing a skin-tight bodysuit that was sparsely covered in pale-gold plating. If not for her royal-blue cape and the small diadem she wore to represent her status as a queen, her aesthetic would have been virtually identical to Scáthach's...</p><p>After the initial shock wore off, a period of time lasting less than a single second, Vahn initiated the conversation, stating plainly, "You are Aife, elder sister to Scáthach...tell me, what end did you expect, attacking my people and assaulting my fortress with such disregard? Though an honorable death is the right of everyone warrior, the fact you surrendered so quickly shows this was not your intention."</p><p>Hearing Vahn's remark, Aife's face became somewhat red due to embarrassment and shame. This was always the worst part when surrendering to an enemy, as, more often than not, female warriors experienced great shame before they were finally released. She knew little about the Sage Dragon Emperor, as it hadn't been all that long since she was summoned. What she did know, however, was that he had an entire army filled with beautiful, and devout, women.</p><p>Taking a few deep breaths to compose herself, Aife met Vahn's gaze without shying away, answering, "I came to meet with my sister. I had hoped to lure her out by making a scene. Unfortunately, as you can see, I seem to have overestimated myself...your forces are truly mighty, Sage Dragon Emperor..."</p><p>Toward the end of her statement, Aife performed a courteous bow, as, after suffering defeat, things like titles and status meant very little. In her era, it wasn't uncommon for survivors to be stripped of their titles and land upon surrendering, the only exception being when the victorious party showed leniency. She had conquered many territories by taking advantage of this principle, gaining vassals by sparing and assimilating various clans into her own.</p><p>Since Aife had a lot of similarities with Scáthach, Vahn was slightly perturbed by her elegance and the amount of emotion she displayed. Thus, in response to her praise, he took a deep breath of his own, asking, "You haven't heard from Shirou and Musashi, I presume?"</p><p>Hearing the familiar names, Aife showed a contemplative expression before ultimately shaking her head and saying, "I have not personally conversed with either in recent memory. After we separated previously, I wandered around the area, slaying strange monsters before stumbling upon the mighty walls of Your Majesty's fortress. After that...well, it is as you see..."</p><p>Seeing Aife draw attention to the golden accessories linked around her wrists and ankles, Vahn gave a small nod before pulling a chair out of his Inventory and saying, "Sit. This could take a while. Before that, however, allow me to explain what happened to your sister. Afterward, you will be free to go. I know of your culture and traditions, but, this is no longer your era. You are free to live as you please, so long as it does not violate the Common Law. Now, before you ask questions, allow me to explain the situation...starting with the death of your sister..."</p><p>Though she had been expecting many things, hearing Vahn mention her sister's death was not one of them. As a result, Aife's mind completely blanked for what felt like several hours, unable to muster any thoughts at all as she passively listened to his recounting of events...</p><p>(A/N: Alternate Titles: 'I'm fast a fuck booooooi~','A meeting between a horse and a cat','RIP Aife's mind...')</p><p>https://bit.ly/2XBzAYu &lt;-(p.atreon link)</p><p>paypal.me/Einlion</p><p>Discord Invite: https://discord.gg/Jwa8PKh</p></main><div class="link-group"><a class="btn" href="01446.html">Previous</a><a class="btn" href="01448.html">Next</a></div></div><div id="readpos">0%</div></body></html>
