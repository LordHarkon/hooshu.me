<p>Vahn was admittedly a little surprised at the interior majesty of the famous St. Peter's Basilica. While it wasn't as impressive as the interior of the Ivory Castle, it was a marvel of architecture and, if not for the lingering emotions clouding the atmosphere, it would have been a truly beautiful sight.</p><p>Unfortunately, even under better circumstances, Vahn wouldn't be afforded the opportunity to look around at his leisure. In fact, after passing the relatively low ranking members of the Clergy, quite a number of bolder individuals had quickly gathered. None made any moves but it was very apparent they did not welcome him within one of their most sanctified halls. This caused the itching sensation that made his skin crawl intensify and, if not for his training with Sc√°thach, Vahn would have had a bit of trouble keeping his bearing.</p><p>Before he had been able to venture too deeply into the structure, the doors leading to the outside were closed by lower-ranking members of the Clergy as a man with scarlet red robes, elbow-length cap, white rochet, and a peculiar white mitre hat with two scarlet tassels. He had a distinctly ancient appearance and, based on the structure of his internal energy, Vahn would peg him around eighty-seven years of age. Despite this, the man had a fierce and determined look in his blazing blue eyes as he stood at the front of the assembly and stated, "Foul creature. You dare bring your heresy into these most hallowed halls?"</p><p>Hearing the man's accusatory and harsh tone, Vahn couldn't help but raise his brow curiously as he rebuffed, "How curious, a man who spins tales of an all-loving, all-forgiving God yet, when meeting a new face for the first time, he immediately resorts to besmirching others and instigating conflict. Tell me, Cardinal, did God personally appoint you to your position or did you, like many others, simply outlive the competition?"</p><p>With his ears, cheeks, and nose gaining a ruddy hue, the Cardinal scowled viciously as venomously stated, "You have no right to speak of our God, Blasphemer! My position is the result of my unerring belief, my willingness to die for the one true God!"</p><p>Stirred by the Cardinal's words, the wholly male gathering seemed to find even greater courage and, as a result, the burning sensation on Vahn's skin more than doubled in intensity. Despite this, he just stood there with a casual smile on his face, stating, "I am not here to speak with a fool who believes in a nameless God. Shouldn't you be off claiming credit for miracles or appropriating the beliefs of other cultures to empower your system of Thaumaturgy further...?"</p><p>Vahn's words were like a slap to the face for everyone present within the room, an assembly that now consisted of nearly three-hundred people. It was well documented that, throughout history, the Roman Catholic Church had borrowed doctrine convenient for themselves while replacing the belief systems of other cultures with their religious symbolism. They had a penchant for rewriting history in the most convenient light, changing their tune whenever it suited them. This was a rather curious thing, considering their God was presumably omnipotent, omniscient, and omnipresent. You would think a being with such power, capable of seeing all points in history simultaneously, would have given them more pertinent instructions...</p><p>Just as the tensions reached a level where they were on the verge of exploding, a chuckle resonated through the vast chamber, immediately drawing the attention of the crowd. Then, in much the same way as the people outside, the gathering of clergymen parted to reveal an old man flanked by four peculiar individuals, each possessing a commendable amount of power, even if it was like four black suns rotating around a much larger, infinitely brighter, white star.</p><p>Despite having one of the highest standings in human society, the Pope actually wore relatively plain robes compared to the other members of the Clergy. If not for the ornate staff in his hands, showing a man crucified on a cross, he would have looked like any normal elderly priest, at least to those who couldn't see what lay beneath. He even walked at a slow pace, his scepter tapping against the hard marble flooring with an audible tap as he approached closer and stated in an aged voice, "So this is the man who God has sent to test our faith...quite a peculiar existence..."</p><p>Hearing the Pope's words, Vahn was somewhat disappointed as he hadn't expected the comparably kind and pure man to spew the same contrived nonsense as the rest. However, considering his post, it wasn't exactly a surprise to hear him say such things. If his beliefs weren't the strongest, there was no way the rest of the Cardinals would have elected him to the position. He was the person who had the highest authority within the most powerful organization in the world, a position not just anyone could fulfill...</p><p>Though he knew it was stepping on a landmine, Vahn decided to respond in a way that would both shock and mortify the procession, asking in a curious tone, "Perhaps you would be more willing to see reason if I resurrected the man you purport a Savior? I wonder if you would even besmirch the person most intrinsic to your faith in your vain attempts to deny the truth...?"</p><p>As if his previously amicable bearing had been an illusion, the Pope's expression hardened into a pointed glare as he gripped the handle of his staff and replied, "I had hoped to discuss the future at length with you...now, I understand there is no limit to your vile machinations. Do not think for even a moment that your words and actions have any weight here. What you have done to the outside is enough to prove the wickedness in your heart. Leave this place, you are no longer welcome within the Vatican. If you have any righteousness at all, you will leave without making a scene."</p><p>Vahn found the Pope's efforts to put himself into a morally superior position rather amusing as, even if he left without causing a scene, the Holy Church, sanctioned by the Pope himself, would not return the courtesy. Rather, so long as the Vatican remained untouched, he did not particularly care about the destruction of entire cities. Even if his people desecrated the holy grounds of other religions, tore apart religious texts, and committed horrible acts in the name of their God, he would ultimately turn a blind eye so long as it did not endanger the interests of the church.</p><p>With his impression of the man completely ruined, Vahn shook his head, smile no longer visible on his face as he stated, "More so than anyone present, I have the most right to be here. You pretend to be a representative of God yet, in all your time, have you ever truly heard 'his' voice? I have the literal being you worship on my person at all times yet, despite this inherent truth, you call me the heretic? Is there a greater form of blasphemy than the denial of one's own God...?"</p><p>Vahn's previous words and actions hadn't earned him any friends among the gathered clergymen but, hearing him essentially denounce their entire faith, he became the focus of everyone's hate in an instant. Curiously, however, the burning sensation on his skin began to gradually fade as, prior to the Pope giving his bodyguards their orders, Alaya appeared, this time in her 'original' state, a ball of pure light that had two rings revolving around it at varying speeds and angles that changed from the perspective of different people.</p><p>Though he hadn't told her to do anything, Alaya's presence caused the peculiar Bounded Field that was supposed to keep people like Vahn away to completely vanish. This had been a great source of confusion for the members of the Holy Church as, with the field still active, he shouldn't have been able to trespass so easily. What they didn't realize, or at least refused to accept, was that their barrier was completely useless in the face of Alaya. Rather, due to the structure of the field, Vahn became the new 'owner' as Alaya had the highest authority within the Vatican by default.</p><p>Suddenly, the Pope began to have a coughing fit as the holy light in his body began to rapidly gain a grey luster before turning just as dark as the rest of the Cardinals. This didn't mean he was an evil person but, having reached the highest position within a religious organization, the number of evil deeds he had been made aware of, yet willfully ignored, had tainted his Ego. Vahn had become able to distinguish whether or not a person was genuinely evil based, not solely on the color of their aura, but the structure and composition as well.</p><p>While three of the four bodyguards supported the Pope, nearly everyone else in the room had their eyes fixed on the true form of Alaya. Her presence was something even the gods themselves would not be able to fully comprehend so, as mortal men, there were a number of people that instantly fell to their knees. At the same time, Alaya spoke in a resonant tone that cowed everyone present as she stated, "Humanity has strayed from the path of righteousness. Vahn Aldrnari Mason will be the figure to guide humanity toward prosperity and the continuation of the species. If you oppose him, do so knowing that my Blessing will not aid you..."</p><p>Under normal circumstances, Alaya would not even bother to interfere with these matters but, as Vahn himself had elected to appear within the Vatican, she was prompted to act. Truthfully, it had never mattered to her what the church believed, so long as they endeavored to ensure the survival of humanity. Now that Vahn had usurped that role, they were a direct threat to the species she was bound to protect. Her power could not be used to oppose Vahn so, the moment they shifted their hatred toward him, she reclaimed the power they had been borrowing for millennia.</p><p>---</p><p>While Alaya was giving her speech, Vahn was feeling out the new authority he had suddenly gained. Previously, his senses couldn't extend very far due to the Bound Field's interference field but, now that he was the owner, Vahn's domain had extended throughout the entirety of the Vatican City. He could even stretch his senses into the chambers deep beneath the city, a fact that caused a frown to immediately develop across his face due to the 'truth' he had discovered.</p><p>The Holy Church had imprisoned a number of entities beneath the city, including humans, spirits, ghosts, Daemons, and other phantasmal species. They were treated as factories to produce various rare materials and resources, kept prisoner for hundreds or even thousands of years to support the interests of the church. It was a truly monstrous affront to basic human decency but, in the name of their silent God, there was very little the church wouldn't resort to if it meant spreading their belief and holding onto their ill-gotten power...</p><p>Shaking his head, Vahn turned to the only person left standing in the room, a woman with silver hair and pale-blue eyes. She was the only female present amongst the members of the clergy and, now that the Pope had lost Alaya's favor, she was by far the strongest person present. At the same time, her aura was almost pitch black and, while not inherently evil, Vahn could tell she had a twisted and vicious nature at a glance.</p><p>Even as everyone else was awed by Alaya's presence, the silver-haired woman had only spared the glowing blue orb a glance before turning her attention back to Vahn. She seemed to be in very deep thought, despite her expression being completely neutral and unperturbed. Then, seemingly having made up her mind, a sadistic smile marred her relatively beautiful face as she mused, "How tragic. To think that the infamous Emperor would march into the heart of the Vatican to murder the Pope and more than ninety percent of the senior clergy..."</p><p>As soon as the woman spoke, the three men helping the Pope paused for a brief moment before one, the second strongest of the trio, pulled out a black, cross-shaped, blade as he attempted to stab it into the Pope's back. At the same time, the other two men pulled out similar blades and, if not for the timely intervention of Vahn, they would have undoubtedly slaughtered the entire assembly in order to twist the truth. Unfortunately for them, Vahn wasn't just going to stand idly by as this event took place so, the moment they moved, all three men were forcibly ejected from the Bounded Field, their bodies transported several kilometers above the surface of the earth, death coming to them almost instantly.</p><p>Due to her power, the woman was not so easily forced away but, as it was never his intention to let her go so easily, Vahn had appeared like a phantom, his hand grasping her neck as she dangling off the ground with a darkening expression. She wasn't even afforded the time to react as Vahn, from the very beginning, had already been anticipating she would do something. Her unstable aura was something you only saw in homicidal maniacs and battle junkies so, if given the chance, violence was her go-to solution to every problem...</p><p>The woman hadn't been quiet with her words so, despite trembling in awe at Alaya's presence, the men in the chamber had all realized what had nearly happened. Despite this, they did not see Vahn in a positive light as, even with something as inexplicable as Alaya present, they adamantly refused to believe they were in the wrong. Instead, they would have rather been killed by the silver-haired woman as it would have made them into Martyrs, uniting their believers and allowing the church to withstand any trials the Empire might impose upon them.</p><p>Realizing this, many of the men that had been cowering began to tear away at their own throats with crucifixes while some elected to bite through their tongues. It was an utterly ridiculous sight but, as it was their choice to make, Vahn just watched with dull eyes while holding the woman up by her neck. He knew that, even if he stopped them, they would either commit suicide later or spend the rest of their days convincing their believers that Vahn was to blame for everything that happened. Even if he released an actual recording of the proceedings, people would just accuse him of falsifying things to suit his agenda, irrespective of the truth...</p><p>Shaking his head, Vahn bound the woman with [Enkidu] before carrying her under his arm like a sack of rice and heading deeper into the basilica. There were hidden passages connecting to a complex network of underground passages and chambers. Here, the secrets of the church were hidden away from the world, truths that would shake the very foundation of their doctrine.</p><p>Now, despite having come with the intention to negotiate, Vahn had thrown decorum out the window after the complete farce he had witnessed. He changed the properties of the Bounded Field to make everyone outside suddenly feel they needed to go home, causing millions of people to file out like zombies. They would be in the way of what was to come as, with their foundation exposed, the Holy Church would stop at nothing to eliminate him...regardless of the innocent lives caught in the crossfire.</p><p>(A/N: Once again, this is pure fiction. I have nothing against the catholic church, or any religious organization for that matter, so don't lambast me over something that has no correlation with reality. The fact I need to say this is rather disheartening but that is the political climate we live in these days x_x...)</p><p>https://bit.ly/2XBzAYu &lt;-(p.atreon link)</p><p>paypal.me/Einlion</p><p>Discord Invite: https://discord.gg/Jwa8PKh</p></main><div class="link-group"><a class="btn" href="01318.html">Previous</a><a class="btn" href="index.html">Table of Contents</a><a class="btn" href="01320.html">Next</a></div></div><div id="readpos">0%</div></body></html>
