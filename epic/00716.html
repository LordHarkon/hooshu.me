<p>After talking about the nature of the Vanir for a short while, Loki eventually asked, "So, when do you want to take care of this? You still have almost two weeks until you were supposed to be able to perform the 'ceremony'. Also, do you intend to actually lay with Freya, or are you going to treat it more like a medical procedure...?" There was a very big difference between the two, for a variety of reasons. If Vahn slept with Freya, which is what she would undoubtedly insist on, it meant he would have the lay with one of the most beautiful and 'prolific' goddesses with a Divinity relaxed to sexual pleasure. Though it wasn't likely to have much of an effect on him, it would still have some small effect on Vahn's mind, at least for a short while after the fact.</p><p>At the same time, a proper union where both parties indulged in their emotions, was far more natural and it would, in essence, ensure that the child was at least born through a mutual union between man and woman. If Vahn chose the second option, insemination through the introduction of semen with a tube, it would almost be 'cruel' to the child that is produced. After all, it would still be Vahn's child and, given his nature, it would potentially influence him for a much longer period of time than just sleeping with Freya. He would have to bear a strange form of guilt that would be present every time he interacted with the Vanir, potentially influencing them negatively since they were often very perceptive.</p><p>Vahn knew what Loki was getting at, which was why he previously mentioned he was interested in Freya's body. She really was a beautiful woman and, with the unique qualities of his body, Vahn was confident he would actually be able to come out ahead in the end. Freya would also be taking a vow to now sleep around until their child had fully matured so, knowing himself well, Vahn knew he would have eventually given in to Freya's insistence. Since he had already decided to be more proactive, Vahn chose to trust in his intuition as he said, "Any child I sire, I want them to be produced in the normal way. Though I'm sure Freya will be 'difficult' to deal with, I'm confident in myself..."</p><p>Remembering some of her most recent experiences with Vahn, Loki couldn't resist the urge to chuckle lightly as she sent a silent prayer towards her fellow goddess. If Vahn got serious about things, even someone like Freya might not be his match. She might have unlimited stamina during sex, but the influence of Vahn's [Hands of Nirvana] and [Grooming] were two things that defied logic at times. Even Syr, possessing a pseudo Divinity related to sex, couldn't actually keep up with Vahn for very long if he truly got serious. Though she wasn't nearly as 'powerful' as Freya, Vahn would also be able to act with fewer inhibitions with a goddess compared to how he would treat a mortal woman, even if Syr was a demigoddess...</p><p>Realizing that Vahn might actually 'win' against Freya, Loki couldn't help but feel intrigued by the prospect. In fact, she actually wanted to be there to witness such an achievement personally and, considering the position she was in, Loki knew she had that option. Since there was no way to prevent Freya's charm from activating naturally, regardless of any vow they had her take, Loki could easily justify it by saying she wanted to make sure Vahn wasn't influenced greatly by Freya in a way that could endanger the Alliance. It wouldn't even be the first time she had watched Freya have sex with someone, so there wasn't much wiggle room for the 'troublesome' goddess to refuse.</p><p>Feeling strangely excited about the prospect, Loki cursed at herself since she could also rationalize that she 'shouldn't' be okay with such things. Though she and Vahn weren't married, Loki still considered him her important life partner, so much so that she would rather cut off her left hand than betray the vow she made in the past. Freya wasn't someone she was comfortable with Vahn being with but, remembering she was the one that orchestrated everything, Loki couldn't help but swallow the bitter tasting emotion as she smiled and said, "I'll tell Freya that she is on the schedule. She might start lingering around the Manor in the future, so make sure you are mentally prepared to deal with her..."</p><p>Vahn nodded his head in understanding while simultaneously thinking about why Loki's aura had fluctuated so greatly for a moment. This line of thought didn't continue for long though, as Loki suddenly said, "To prevent her from trying anything, I intend to observe the event from start to finish. I don't mind if you want to 'defeat' her, but make sure you are decisive about things and consider the consequences properly. A woman like Freya, who had never lost a night battle, might not behave rationally if you manage to 'subjugate' her. She might even become much worse than Anubis..."</p><p>This time, neither one of Vahn's thought processes could fully function as his thoughts wandered to the experience he had shared with Anubis nearly two weeks prior. It was almost impossible to imagine someone being more 'extreme' than Anubis but, considering it was Loki warning him, Vahn believed there was some truth to the matter. After all, Freya was the type of woman that 'broke' people while trying to help them reach their full potential. If she truly suffered a defeat in a category she was 'peerless' at, the impact might completely alter her personality and how the acted around him. Just imagining a 'loyal' and 'devoted' Freya that waited upon him made Vahn feel a sinking feeling in his stomach. Yes, she was a very beautiful woman, but the image of a love-crazed Freya was more than a little unnerving...</p><p>Seeing that he took her warning seriously, Loki nodded her head but added, "Still, it may be for the best. If you don't defeat her decisively, Freya is the type of woman that would eventually fall into her old habits and potentially do something troublesome. Though it isn't guaranteed, as she would be hard pressed to find someone more capable than you, it doesn't mean she wouldn't eventually try to 'make' someone more capable. If you conquer her body, mind, and heart, however, she is far less likely to go to such extremes...however, you wouldn't be able to get away from her too easily if you take that route."</p><p>Vahn tilted his head back, looking upwards at the roof while his thoughts flowed like a tumultuous river in his mind. Surprisingly, this didn't last for too long since Sis suddenly said, (*Vahn, don't forget that there are a functionally infinite number of ways you can deal with such troubles in the future. Once the tier of the record is increased, or when you link it to a higher tiered record, goddesses like Freya won't be nearly as problematic as before. Now only will the laws forcing them to follow the compulsions of their Divinity be mitigated, but her power might not even be worth mentioning in the grand scheme of things...*)</p><p>Hearing Sis's words, Vahn knew she was right but, at the same time, he also knew that it likely meant he would be with Freya for a 'very' long period of time. Even if he only spent a few years in this record before moving on, he would inevitably return in the future. His own lifespan stretched into eternity so, unless something changed that forced them apart, Vahn knew he wouldn't really be able to 'abandon' Freya. Realizing this, Vahn cemented his determination and, though it wouldn't be easy, he intended to lay the foundation for 'changing' Freya for the better.</p><p>It might not happen any time soon, but when the restriction on the record was removed, Vahn was certain her personality could be developed in a positive direction. After all, Freya wasn't truly evil and, like other gods, simply gave in to the compulsions of her Divinity. She might have enjoyed it more than some, which could make her seem cruel and heartless, but Freya had also lived for well over four-hundred million years before descending to the mortal world. Compared to what she had given of herself to the record, the impact she had on the mortal world was inconsequential by comparison. He actually had the ability to make her treat people better in the future, so Vahn decided he would do just that...</p><p>Sensing the change in Vahn, Loki tilted her head up to look at him through her slightly parted eyes. She didn't know what decision he had made but, feeling the confidence practically radiating off of him, Loki couldn't help but smile slightly while turning around in his lap. With the same smile on her face, she linked her arms around his neck and mused, "I wonder what you're thinking about~?" Yet, without waiting for an answer, Loki pulled herself up to Vahn's face, sealing his lips as her tongue invaded his mouth. She noticed a peculiar 'flavor' intermixed with his saliva and, after separating their lips, asked, "You were with another girl before you came to me? My, I didn't mean to interrupt anything...kukuku~."</p><p>Vahn's eyes squinted, gazing into Loki's gem-like red eyes as he traced his hands slowly down her back until reaching the supple and plush butt she so proudly touted in the past. With a glimmer in his own eyes, Vahn smiled and said, "I'm troubled by my own popularity, but not to the extent that I'm bothered by when my hard-working trickster goddess wants my affection..." Moving his fingers in a practiced manner, Vahn began to massage Loki's butt as the latter released a hot sigh, asking, "What do you mean, 'my' goddess~?"</p><p>The moment Loki's words ended, Vahn put more pressure into his hands, firmly gripping Loki's butt through the thin fabric of her shorts as he tilted his head and stated, "After everything you've done for me, no, for us...our family...there is no way I would let you get away. Ten, a thousand, or even a million years, the amount of time doesn't matter...you are, always and forever, 'my' Loki..." Strangely, Vahn felt his heart flutter a great deal when he said those words. Even his hands gripping Loki's butt felt 'itchy' and he had a very strong urge to begin massaging them once again. If she wasn't convinced by his words, Vahn was more than willing to 'show' her how serious he was...</p><p>Loki had also started breathing audibly as her slit-like eyes had opened into a more natural shape, both ruby-like irises fixed to his face. She also felt a unique and inexplicable giddiness spreading through her body, unlike anything she had experienced in the past. Vahn's words echoed through her mind and resonated like an 'absolutely truth' that not even her Divinity could resist. There were no schemes cooking up in her head, not plots turning over in the deep recesses of her mind, just those resolute words, almost like a promise that had been carved into her very soul. Tightening her grip around his neck, Loki firmly stated a few words of her own, decisively and resolutely, "Show me..."</p><p>---</p><p>Several hours later, the naked Loki leaned into Vahn's chest, tracing her fingers over the lines of his muscles with a calm and natural expression on her blushing face. Her eyes, instead of forming their characteristic slits, were almost completely open as a watery haze covered their surface. The ruby-colored irises seemed to glimmer as the low light of the room reflected in their depths. She had actually made plans for the afternoon but, after he began 'proving' his claim to her, Loki felt like her arrangements didn't matter at all. It would be troublesome to reschedule things later, and the other party would likely complain, but Loki didn't care right now. The only thing that seemed to matter was the warmth of the boy she was laying against.</p><p>Reaching his hand forward, Vahn tilted Loki's head up so he could look directly into her unveiled eyes. He waited for some clarity to return to their depths before saying, "You know, you really do have beautiful eyes, Loki. They sparkle like precious gemstones...with such a deep and rich color..." As he spoke, Vahn traced his thumb under Loki's right eye, continuing his movement until his palm came to rest on her cheek. Threads of energy spread from his fingers as Vahn slowly moved his hand passed Loki's ear, combing it through her hair while leaning forward and kissing her once again.</p><p>Loki had been in a daze when she heard his words, euphoria when she felt his touch, and sublimely contented when he began kissing her again. Firmly grabbing his head in turn, Loki passionately reciprocated his kiss to the best of her ability, almost like she was 'compelled' to do so by emotions she couldn't grasp completely. Like before, the only thing that seemed to matter was this single moment, the 'man' holding her, and the kiss they were sharing. Everything else seemed so insignificant, inconsequential even...</p><p>It didn't seem like Loki planned to release him any time soon, so Vahn brought his right hand, which had previously been resting on her hip, and slowly traced it up her spine. Loki ceased kissing him almost immediately, eyes wide open as she put on an expression where she didn't know if she should be inhaling or exhaling. When he reached her neck, most of the strength had left her body and her muscles made the decision for her, causing Loki to release a long and hot sigh against Vahn's chest. In a lazy monotone, Loki muttered, "This...I don't know what this is..." while part of her mind slowly started to regain its clarity.</p><p>Tracing his left hand up her abdomen, bringing it to a stop on her right breast, Vahn leaned down and whispered into her ear, "I told you...you're mine, Loki...this is the proof..." Drawing a small circle with his thumb, outlining Loki's nipple, the petite goddess began to tremble with a powerful reverberation while 'clinging' onto his body for support. After what they had done earlier, Loki's sensitivity was almost synchronized with his intent. If Vahn wanted her to feel pleasure, her body wouldn't be able to offer any resistance at all. Instead, the feeling would be amplified greatly but, unlike the 'dazed release' she would experience in a normal situation, Loki was hyper-aware of everything that was happening.</p><p>Much like he had done with Hephaestus, though only twice, Vahn had 'melded' with Loki by intertwining his domain with her aura. For those few hours, it was almost like they had become a single entity except, unlike how he burned like a furnace alongside Hephaestus, his synchronization with Loki had the unique property of 'reversing' the influence of her Divinity. Instead of thinking about schemes and tricks, the only thing going through Loki's mind was a sense of unity and a compulsion to simply 'be'. Vahn knew this because, as their bodies and minds had melded together, he felt the same thing as she did. The only reason he was able to recover faster was because of the influence of his [Will of the Emperor], the ever-reliable skill that had always supported him in the past.</p><p>In a similar method as before, Loki felt Vahn's words playing over in her mind and, like a sacred decree carved into stone, they became permanently affixed at the very core of her being. A very affectionate glow spread through her eyes as rubbed her cheek against his chest and mused, "I guess that's that then...looks like I'm stuck with you for all eternity...ufufufufu~." Though said in a playful manner, Loki pricked her index finger as a drop of red blood, glowing with a divine light, flowed from the small incision before merging with the powerful energy that had started to invade the room. Several chains, containing powerful binding laws, latched onto Loki's body as the Eternal Vow she swore in her heart took effect...she didn't vocalize it, but Loki swore to the powers beyond Heaven that she would walk at Vahn's side throughout all of eternity, so long as he wanted her at his side...</p><p>Vahn was shocked when he saw the chains emerge so suddenly and, though he was firm in his conviction, he couldn't help but feel he had wronged Loki somehow. It felt like he had manipulated her to do something she would have never done under normal circumstances. However, before he said anything, Loki brought her hands to the sides of his face and resolutely stated, "This is my conviction...I've imprinted your words on my very soul, Vahn. From now on, unless you set me aside, I 'am' your's...now and forever..." He had said the words in full seriousness previously but, hearing Loki repeat them back to him, Vahn couldn't help but swallow hard while nodding his head.</p><p>Soon after, the worries he had slowly started to fade away as he continued looking into her resolute eyes and, by the time several long seconds had passed, Vahn felt pride, accomplishment, and, more than anything else, love for the goddess who had just made an Eternal Vow on his behalf. It was already late, and others within the residence would undoubtedly wonder what had been going on inside the room, but Vahn felt like it would be impossible to simply leave things on such a note. Thus, though they had already been at it for several hours previously, Vahn and Loki began to consummate their promise to each other...this time with more feelings for each other than either previously thought possible...</p><p>---</p><p>As the 'aura' emitted by the world when an Eternal Vow was made had a very strong impression, every goddess within the Manor, and all the girls who had witnessed Hephaestus' vow during the wedding, had been very shocked by the sudden condensation of energy. Hestia, Hephaestus, and Anubis all turned toward the direction of Vahn's study as Hestia silently muttered, "That Loki...?" Having known Loki for a very long time, and spending eons as arch-rivals, Hestia couldn't believe that she would actually make an Eternal Vow so suddenly. However, now that it had happened, she began to smile radiantly as a slight aura erupted from her pristine blue irises. Now, three goddesses had made Eternal Vows to Vahn and Hestia began to feel like their family had become much stronger as a result...</p><p>Anubis, being the only goddess closely associated with Vahn who had yet to make an Eternal Vow, began to seriously consider the matter. Unfortunately, her previous vow conflicted with her ability to do so and, unless she returned to Heaven by means beyond her own, she would never be able to show the same level of dedication as the other goddesses. Realizing this, Anubis brought her hands up like she was about to pray, firmly resolving to serve her Master to the best of her abilities. When she was done, Anubis made her way into the underground section of the Manor and followed the long tunnel connecting to the Manor Loki had constructed to the North. It was rarely used but, after finding out some of its secrets, Anubis had been making preparations of her own. She eventually reached a corridor that seemed to extend deeper into the labyrinthine underground structure. Pressing a panel on the wall, Anubis waited for the mechanism to reveal the secret room beyond, furnished with a large bed and a variety of useful tools...</p><p>Hephaestus hadn't been that surprised by Loki making an Eternal Vow, as she had actually expected it to happen even earlier. She was, however, curious about the terms of the vow itself and planned to inquire about it later. For now, she gathered up the girls in the Manor and they began to discuss the matter amongst themselves. When some of the girls expressed their own intentions of making an Eternal Vow with Vahn, Hephaestus couldn't help but laugh as she lightly reprimanded them. Mortals making an Eternal Vow were arguably more dangerous than gods, as it would follow them through their future incarnations. Vahn had already talked to them about the prospect of immortality so, if the girls wanted to make Eternal Vows, Hephaestus laid out the requirement that they would need to reach that stage first...</p><p>(A/N: For those that have forgotten, Hestia made an Eternal Vow dedicating her everything to Vahn. Hephaestus made an Eternal Vow swearing that Vahn will be the last man she ever loves. Loki made an Eternal Vow swearing she will stand by Vahn's side until he no longer wants her there. Heavy stuff, when you consider the youngest among them is around 420kk years old. Godhand is quite fearsome (UwU). Also, next series of chapters is going to be erotica with VahnxLilixNaaza. Since I usually write such content at the beginning of a writing session, I'll be ending my day here early. In exchange, I'll be releasing a few chapters of Fenrir's Journey if you want to check it out (UwU)~!)</p><p>(A/N: Alternate Titles: 'RIP Freya...?','Dual Cultivation is Dangerous (o,...,o)','Anubis' Determination o_o')</p><p>https://bit.ly/2XBzAYu &lt;-(p.atreon link)</p><p>paypal.me/Einlion</p><p>Discord Invite: https://discord.gg/Jwa8PK</p></main><div class="link-group"><a class="btn" href="00715.html">Previous</a><a class="btn" href="00717.html">Next</a></div></div><div id="readpos">0%</div></body></html>
