<p>Nearly an hour after their playful foray in the bath, Vahn was sitting comfortably at a low-lying table, an amused expression on his face as Tamamo dutifully fed him bits and pieces of food using chopsticks. She had changed back into her wedding kimono, and, somewhat amusing, kept feeding him dishes filled with eel, Ginko nuts, and umaimo, each intended to increase his libido further.</p><p>Vahn knew what Tamamo was trying to do, but, as such things were completely useless against him, he didn't mind teasing her by eating far more than his fill. It was interesting seeing her fidget about excitedly, all while trying to put on the act of a demure and attentive wife.</p><p>Eventually, after feeding him what must have been more than twenty dishes, Tamamo asked, "Are you beginning to feel full, Ten'nō-sama? I would feel terrible if you were to suffer an ailment of the stomach. Perhaps we should stop here...?"</p><p>Rather than answer Tamamo immediately, Vahn extended his hand, picking up a saucer filled with hazy-white sake, downing the cup's contents before saying, "Thanks for the meal, Tamamo. Don't worry, I made sure to leave space for dessert..."</p><p>Understanding the meaning behind his words, Tamamo's tail began to twitch more aggressively behind her back, bringing a larger smile to Vahn's face. Then, after setting his sake cup back on the table, he languidly rose to his feet, stretching his body before picking up a surprised Tamamo in a bridal carry.</p><p>Though she seemed more eager for what was to come than he was, Tamamo smiled seductively while resting her head against Vahn's chest, saying, "My, you certainly seem excited, Ten'nō-sama. There is no need to be in such a rush, you know~? Tamamo will properly satisfy all your needs, no matter how extreme they might be, ufufufu~."</p><p>As he had already carried her over to the bed, Vahn set Tamamo down just as her words came to an end. This allowed her to turn onto her hands and knees, wiggling her butt seductively as she scurried further into the bed he had set out. As a result, Vahn was able to see the fair white hairs that grew on the underside of her tail, poking through the large red ribbon that adorned the back of her obi. The rest of her tail was the traditional 'rusty-red' color associated with most foxes, so, it created a strangely tantalizing contrast with the rest of her tail's coating...</p><p>Just as Tamamo had reached the head of the bed and was about to invite Vahn to join her, she was slightly startled when an invisible force tugged her back towards him. When she looked back, she could see Vahn with a teasing smile on his face, gesticulating as if he were telling her to come toward him. This made her feel a little giddy with anticipation, so, while it wouldn't have required much effort to break free, she made no effort to resist his telekinetic pull.</p><p>Once she was within his grasp, Vahn reached his hand out, stroking Tamamo's butt through the fabric of her kimono as he said, "You have a thin waist but a discernibly plump butt...I had seen it during the bath, but, now that you're shaking it right in front of me...you can't expect me to simply ignore it, can you...?"</p><p>Hearing Vahn's words, Tamamo giggled mischievously while writhing about under his surprisingly stimulating hand. Then, with squinted eyes and a raspy, inviting, tone, she muttered, "If it pleases Ten'nō-sama, my butt, my tail, even my ears...they are yours to do with as you please~."</p><p>Rather than respond to Tamamo's words with his own, Vahn simply smiled in response, increasing the amount of energy he was putting into his [Hands of Nirvana]. This caused a shiver to run from the base of her tail to the top of her head, temporarily replacing her seductive smile with a look of mild shock as he began massaging near the base of her tail.</p><p>Before she realized it, Tamamo was sticking out her butt a little more, following the movements of his hand with a progressively ruddy face. Vahn could even feel her body rapidly heat up through the silken lining of her kimono, bringing a smile to his face as he said, "I am going to teach you a very important lesson, Tamamo. You see, while I don't mind being serviced...it isn't wrong to say I am more fond of satisfying my women. I often go out of my way to make sure they are able to feel the greatest amount of pleasure their bodies and minds can tolerate...are you prepared to receive my affection...?"</p><p>To punctuate his statement, Vahn sent a wave of Source Energy through Tamamo's body while pressing his thumb into her sacrum bone. This translated into a mild pain that quickly gave way to far greater pleasure, interrupting her attempt at a response. Instead, she was forced to release a sonorous moan, her back arching slightly as her nails dug into the fabric of the bed, tearing the sheets and digging deep into the foamy mattress.</p><p>Seeing the destruction caused to the relatively durable mattress, Vahn made a mental note to be wary of Tamamo's nails later on. For the time being, however, he continued to gently stimulate the same spot, forcing her tail to twitch madly in response. As a result, Tamamo clenched her teeth in a vain attempt to stifle her voice, but, failing to do so, she peered back at him and saying, "Please don't tease me, Ten'nō-sama..."</p><p>Hearing Tamamo's plea, Vahn stopped pressing into her sacrum bone, focusing more on her soft rump as he said, "You didn't answer my question..."</p><p>Though she was initially confused by his words, Tamamo's mind quickly recalled what Vahn had said previously. She found this rather amusing, but, as it wasn't that uncommon for powerful men to request such things, he adopted an imploring expression as she whined, "Tamamo wants it...I can't live without Ten'nō-sama's affection any longer. Please, ravish Tamamo's body...let me feel your 'affection' deep inside me~."</p><p>Vahn was slightly taken aback by Tamamo's words, but, as they were also quite stimulating, he issued a light chuckle before squeezing her butt rather firmly. Then, causing Tamamo's tail to flicker madly, he pulled at the obi holding her kimono together, tearing away the fabric with a bit of force. This seemed to be strangely important to her, so, while it seemed somewhat wasteful, Vahn wanted their first time together to be memorable.</p><p>With nothing binding the cloth to her body, Tamamo's kimono came loose, allowing Vahn to pull it away from her with a few tugs. She made a pretense of resisting, issuing a few girlish squeals in the process, but it hadn't actually taken much effort to remove the previously pristine garment. As a result, he was able to see her naked body once again, this time from one of his favorite angles...</p><p>Though she was a petite and fair-skinned woman, appearing in her late teens or early twenties, Tamamo's figure was rather enticing. She not only had a rather sizeable bust, measuring to just over 86cm, but her butt was equally as plump, trailing only 1.3cm behind her bosom. Since she also had a thin waist, measuring 57cm, and rather thick thighs, Tamamo's figure could only be described as 'deceptively mature'. After all, a kimono was well-suited to hiding a woman's figure, so, with Tamamo only being 160cm in height, she gave off the impression of a dainty young girl while fully clothed...</p><p>After tracing his finger down the line of Tamamo's back, eliciting a hot sigh and a hazy look from the eager kitsune, Vahn gave his best 'predatory' smile as he said, "I guess it's time for dessert..."</p><p>Without waiting for Tamamo's response, Vahn grabbed the sides of her waist, pulling her hips closer to him before nestling his face near her hairless slit, probing the palpitating vulva with his tongue. This was a rather 'new' experience for Tamamo, as she was almost always on the giving end, so she couldn't help but feel a little helpless while wondering what kind of man her husband was. These types of thoughts didn't last long, however, as she felt his unnaturally long tongue hit a few sensitive spots, almost like he knew exactly where all of her weak spots were...</p><p>As was often the case with Goddesses, and those descended from them, Tamamo's love juices were uncharacteristically sweet, and, in more ways than one, highly addictive. Though Vahn was immune to their influence, it didn't stop him from enjoying the unique flavor, reminding him of a curious combination between citrus and honey. It even made his tongue tingle slightly, the result of her Divinity interacting with his [Magia Erebea] constitution.</p><p>One of the 'funnest' parts of performing 'cunnilingus' on his lovers was experiencing the ways in which their interior folds reacted to his experimental probing. He never grew tired of seeing their reactions, and, when he got serious, even women like Ishtar and Nobunaga would quickly submit to his ceaseless exploration. Tamamo proved no exception to this, as, despite only a few minutes passing since he started, she was practically straddling his head, her back arched in a precarious arc as her nails dug deep into the bedding.</p><p>Since her body had practically been in heat from the moment they went into the bath together, Vahn knew it was rather 'mean' to delay things for too long. Thus, after gently tracing the tip of his tongue near Tamamo's cervix, causing her body to tremble on the verge of a powerful climax, he pulled away, allowing her a moment's reprieve as she stared back at him with a lost, confused, and moderately annoyed expression on her face.</p><p>Being denied an orgasm was never pleasant, so, despite the fact she had been enjoying each moment thus far, Tamamo's clarity returned with a vengeance when the stimulation suddenly ceased. This caused Vahn to issue a light chuckle, lightly smacking her butt as he said, "Don't worry, I'm not trying to tease you."</p><p>To prove the veracity of his words, Vahn extended his hand to Tamamo, waiting for her to grab it before pulling her to face him. Then, before she could fully understand his intentions, he forced her onto the bed, lifting her right thigh as he dexterously guided himself to her entrance. This was enough to cause a look of abject shock to pass over Tamamo's face, but, before she was able to utter so much as a single syllable, a choking sound escaped her throat as he forced his way deep into her steamy depths.</p><p>For several seconds, Tamamo found it impossible to breathe, an intense pressure filling up her insides as a phenomenal wave of pleasure wreaked havoc throughout her body. It was only when Vahn pressed his hand against her diaphragm that a gasping moan escaped her lips, followed by a period of heaving as her mind and body struggled to adapt to the sudden stimulus.</p><p>Tamamo was feeling more excited in these few moments than she had in her entire life, but, as everything was all so 'new to her', she found it impossible to organize her thoughts. All she could do was go along with the flow, leaving everything to Vahn as he toyed with her body in ways she never thought possible. He exposed parts of her she didn't even know existed, carving his name into each of them as he lay claim to her everything. It was a slightly terrifying experience, but, as his presence also brought her a strange feeling of comfort, Tamamo found herself sinking deeper into an abyss of pleasure with absolutely no desire to resist...</p><p>(A/N: Alternate Titles: 'Tamamo was not prepared','Vahn is a tyrant','RIP vulpine waifu...')</p><p>https://bit.ly/2XBzAYu &lt;-(p.atreon link)</p><p>paypal.me/Einlion</p><p>Discord Invite: https://discord.gg/Jwa8PKh</p></main><div class="link-group"><a class="btn" href="01461.html">Previous</a><a class="btn" href="index.html">Table of Contents</a><a class="btn" href="01463.html">Next</a></div></div><div id="readpos">0%</div></body></html>
