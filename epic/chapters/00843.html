<p>When his words fell upon Freya's ears, Vahn saw her aura practically explode with a passionate red as her stoic expression softened slightly. This caused Vahn's own smile to reach his eyes, finding her behavior rather adorable, especially with how she tried to keep up her facade in front of the other four girls. The fact that she did this, while wearing a transparent garment, created a 'gap' that Vahn found amusing, even though he was aware this could have very well been her intention from the start. Based on how quickly she collected herself, Vahn assumed this was the case and allowed his eyes to wander towards the corridor where the other four girls had emerged earlier...</p><p>Seeing where Vahn was looking, Freya's own smile turned slightly mischevious as she said, "No peeking..." in a sultry tone. This brought Vahn's eyes back to her, his gaze burning her skin and causing her heart to seize up in expectation. She found herself averting her eyes away, strangely unable to maintain eye contact with the emotional turmoil and expectation her body was feeling. Vahn's 'reward' was something that her body craved to an almost maddening extent but Freya tried to pretend she was calm, looking toward the four girls and saying, "From this point onward, Vahn is your Master...you no longer have to listen to my orders, so long as Vahn himself does not grant me that right..."</p><p>As this was also something they had discussed and rehearsed previously, all four girls bowed politely to Freya before standing straight, four sets of eyes focusing on Vahn as if they were awaiting his orders. He could tell that, amongst the four of them, Merribelle and Katsuya seemed a little 'too excited' for the order that rested on the very tip of his tongue. However, though he knew Freya would probably enjoy it quite a bit, Vahn smiled casually as he said, "For the time being, I'll have the four of you wait in the side room to keep Freya's other 'surprise' company. I don't want the four of you thinking I'll treat you however I please so, until you have a better understanding of my character, you will be left in the charge of the Hearth Manor's 'Administrator', Syr Flova..."</p><p>Seeing Katsuya and Merribelle 'deflate' while Momo and Elizabelle actually perked up a bit, Vahn's eyes squinted in amusement. Though he was certainly interested in the rather buxom group of women, having them watch as he made love to Freya was a little more deviant than he felt like being at the moment. Freya might want them to watch and temper themselves as 'proper' servants, but Vahn had never treated anyone under his care in such a fashion. He would rather help set the girls on their path towards the future and, when their feelings mature a bit, that would be the best time to 'pluck' them. Since they were all virgins, even though Momo was surprisingly 71 years old, Vahn didn't want their first times to be under such 'peculiar' circumstances...(A/N: Oni have a lifespan of around 600 years.)</p><p>Without a word of complaint, even though Merribelle clearly had a few words to say, the four bowed in a very prim and proper manner before walking in an orderly line as they followed his order. It was obvious they had spent, at the very least, several months training to become Maids. Since Freya had purged the Entertainment district more than a year and a half ago, it was possible some of them had been 'groomed' from that point into becoming proper Maids for this very moment. This being the case, Vahn wondered who the fifth person Freya was keeping hidden could be...well, he would let her keep it a secret for now as there were more pressing matters to attend...</p><p>Once the girls had exited the room, Vahn matched Freya's gaze before resting his head atop his fist with his elbow on the armrest. Since she had probably been planning this 'surprise' for a long time, Vahn felt like he should give her a reward that he had been keeping in reserve for quite a while. Until now, he had never 'melded' with Freya, as that was a level of closeness that was very dangerous for anyone to experience. Vahn could still clearly remember how drastically Hephaestus, Loki, Hestia, Anubis, and Eirene had changed after he melded with their Divinity. Even Loki, having a Divinity that would cause her to plot and scheme, had turned incredibly docile and genuinely affectionate after the true union of their Divinity and his domain...</p><p>The only thing that kept Vahn from melding with Freya was the slight fear that she would become 'addicted' to the experience, as her Divinity was already associated with Sex. The other goddesses were actually a little 'shaken' by the experience, though not of them had offered a single word of complaint, so Vahn knew it was a defining moment in their incredibly long lives. When this thought crossed his mind, however, Vahn remembered that he was already bound to Freya for what could very well be an eternity. He couldn't exactly keep such an experience from her and, considering it could actually change her for the better, Vahn decided it was time to truly become one with the rather excited goddess who was anxiously awaiting his words...</p><p>After checking to make sure there was plenty of room on the throne, Vahn sat up straight and stored his clothes away within his Inventory. Freya's inhaled a slightly deeper breath through her nose as Vahn gestured her over, saying, "This will probably be unlike anything you've experienced before, Freya...come, sit..." Though he said 'sit', Vahn's dragon was already eyeing the heavens, striking a fierce and indomitable figure. Freya, understanding his 'command', walked over with slightly hurried steps as she gingerly stepped onto the throne's seat, legs spread as a tantalizing sight filled Vahn's vision. He still found it very peculiar that her vagina seemed to 'glow' with a divine light but was no longer surprised by this face and just absentmindedly blew towards the already moist mound.</p><p>Freya's body trembled slightly when she felt Vahn's breath touch her sacred grounds but she didn't slow her actions at all, placing her hands on his shoulders while lowering her hips. Vahn didn't even need to position himself to enter Freya as she very skillfully managed to target her own entrance before his dragon was already raging through her heavenly palace. Freya released a long and sensual moan, craning her head back as she adjusted her legs from a squatting position until she was completely sitting against Vahn's lap, a zero-distance between their hips. Vahn teased her a little, reaching out his hand to pat her head gently as he said, "Good girl..."</p><p>Though she already had a flushed face, Freya's blush developed a few shades redder as she fought against her urges to try and 'take' from Vahn. She wanted nothing more than to just grab his face and begin kissing but, knowing that this could have a negative impact on their future interactions, Freya desperately resisted trying to take the lead. This caused Vahn's expression to soften a bit, something that always made Freya's heart thump in a way that only he could manage to inspire...</p><p>Knowing that Freya was probably 'suffering' a bit, Vahn pulled her into a very gentle embrace, whispering into her ear, "No matter how intense things get, I will be here to hold you close...you should hold me tightly as well, okay, Freya...?" Though she didn't understand what Vahn wanted to do, Freya lightly nodded her head before wrapping her arms around Vahn, finding their current position to be very intimate and comfortable. She was beginning to suspect this was one of the time he just wanted to focus on 'intimacy', instead of doing anymore more intense. However, just as this somewhat sad thought crossed her mind, Freya's eyes widened into full circles as her Divinity itself began to tremble...</p><p>Compression his domain into the confine of the room, Vahn began to fuse with the passionate red aura of Freya, intertwining the two different forces until they had become one. As this happened, something rather unexpected occurred and Freya's body was immediately shrouded in her Divine Power, enveloping both of their bodies as the two black lilies in her hair fell away. Freya's silver eyes became wine-red as her silver hair gained a pink hue and began to curl up slightly. Unlike in the past, this was her actual Divinity taking effect with its Arcanum, not the restricted Divinity that most gods would have in the mortal world. In normal circumstances, this would have caused her to immediately be ejected from the world but, as if driven by instinct, nine links of [Enkidu] had emerged from the void, forming a dome around their bodies that prevented the massive influx of energy to spreading beyond the confined space within...</p><p>From an outside perspective, they would see nothing by a bright pink sphere that was bound by resplendent golden chains, causing the void around to tremble as sensual sighs and moans dispersed into the surroundings. The energy contained by the sphere actually leaked out slightly with these sounds, cutting through all physical obstructions and seeding itself in the hearts and minds of anyone in the surroundings. Though the Arcanum itself was restrained, the influence of Freya's Divinity had spread for several kilometers around her residence, causing the bodies of everyone within to begin heating up. Those closer to the center, especially the five girls in the side room, had even collapsed from the unexpected stimulus, eyes glazed over as they eagerly endeavored to ease the 'suffering' of their bodies...</p><p>Unaware of what was going on outside, Vahn's eyes and mouth were sending out beams of light that matched the color of Freya's Arcanum as she desperately clung to his body, trembling and shaking as her own had almost turned into a pure-light construct. There were small feather-like protrusions rising from her skin as her hair extended to the floor and continued to fan out. This was a form that could only exist in Heaven and Freya felt like Vahn was pulling her real self into the mortal world, an unimaginable pleasure completely overwhelming the entirety of her existence. Vahn was experiencing a very similar thing, his voice resonating outward without ceasing for even an instant, producing a sensual 'ohm' sound that had already gone on for several minutes...</p><p>While Vahn and Freya were 'beyond' themselves, Sis was observing everything quietly from the deep recesses of Vahn's mind, documenting the changes in his body and ensuring that his mental state wasn't compromised. There was a very powerful Divine Energy flowing through his body, carrying with it an irresistible compulsive force and unrestrained 'charm'. However, as if it was completely tamed by the Source Energy in Vahn's body, the only effect this Divine Energy had was nourishing Vahn's cells while being nourished by the Source Energy in turn. It would then loop back into Freya's body, causing the changes in her physique as her mortal avatar became even more refined, pulling even more of her Arcanum into the Mortal World...</p><p>Ever since Vahn first 'melded' with a goddess, Sis had been documenting every change his body experienced, comparing it against the information contained in the hundreds of thousands of texts Vahn had accumulated. She knew the actual technique he was using was very similar to a Cultivation worlds 'Dual Cultivation'. The primary difference was, Vahn's body didn't actually contain generic Yang Energy since he was entirely comprised of Source. Though he could emulate the effects, it was entirely unnecessary and, as a result, Vahn didn't need the nourishment of his partner's Yin to grow strong. Instead, he could meld his Source Energy with the 'everything' of his partner, regardless of their elemental affinity and constitution. The Source Energy in his body would refine others while 'tempering' Vahn's body and soul in exchange, further increasing his capabilities with absolutely no detrimental effects...</p><p>This time, Sis could sense the cells in Vahn's body expanding slightly as the membrane around his soul became suffused with a slightly pink hue. At the same time, his [Charm] Development Ability had been elevated directly to A-Rank, something that gave Sis the urge to laugh since it would probably cause Vahn to 'lament' later. In fact, though it was hard to discern this kind of thing, Sis felt like it may actually reach S-Rank and evolve if the two continued to go at it for a while, not that they were actually doing much. From the start, even though nearly half an hour had passed, Freya just clung to Vahn as if she was afraid of disappearing while he kept her firmly within his embrace and just 'sat' there...even though they were both experiencing an unimaginable amount of pleasure...</p><p>For the better part of an hour, much to the lamentation of others in the surroundings, Vahn and Freya continued to meld together until the beams of light from his eyes and mouth slowly began to recede. At this point, Freya's body was almost entirely comprised of light that had a pink hue along the edges but appeared pristine white towards the center. There was a very subtle rainbow hue near where her heart would be located as her hair slowly dispersed into particles. Small strips of what appeared to be fair white skin emerged from the void, arranging themselves like puzzle pieces to cover Freya's body, slowing restoring her appearance. However, even when her entire body was covered, a few very noticeable changes had occurred that would very soon cause a stir within the godly community...</p><p>Though her hair had regained its silvery color, Freya's eyes remained wine red as her previously black pupils now had a pink light emanating from within. The maker's mark on her body had disappeared from her backside, as it had vanished away with her previous flesh, but there was now a strange crest located between her two immaculate breasts. This crest had the appearance of a sword-like cross that was flanked by two wing-like protrusions that had three defined points. Though it was primarily dark red in color, the interior of the 'sword' glowed with a divine light that matched the color of Freya's Arcanum...</p><p>Less noticeable, at least to outsiders, was the fact that Freya's insides had also been nourished by her 'connection' with Vahn. Though it already had a divine glow before, Freya's vagina now had a subtle pink hue to it as her inner walls actually emanated the same light as her Arcanum. She felt like her insides had actually been sculpted to match Vahn completely as his penis was also glowing with the light of her Arcanum, causing Vahn to be unable to even breath as the chains of [Enkidu] that were previously forming a dome around them became limp. The throne and its surroundings had also changed a great deal, now appearing a strange golden color that had a pink sheen to it, even though the floor was still 'seemingly' made of marble...</p><p>Unlike Vahn, Freya was able to breathe and was doing so very laboriously, a layer of sweat covering her entire body as she gasped for air. She wasn't entirely aware of the changes to her body just yet but knew that something 'impossible' had just occurred. Though only vague memories of her union with Vahn remained, those that she could recall caused her body to tremble as she instinctually tightened up, causing Vahn to groan and hug her a little tighter. This action made Freya's heart feel fluttery and, if she could freely move her body right now, nothing could have stopped her from seeking out Vahn's lips...</p><p>With Freya clamping around him, Vahn's awareness was returned and he actually couldn't even 'feel' his own penis right now, just a pure sense of pleasure. It was a ridiculous incongruity that was nearly able to break through the influence of his [Will of the Emperor] based on the sensation alone. Vahn, for the first time, felt a sense of urgency as he lifted Freya's butt and tried to remove himself from her insides. This caused a bright light to emanate from where they were connected as Freya immediately became teary-eyed and mewled, "Noooo...stay..."</p><p>Vahn felt his heart tighten in his chest but continued pulling out, something that seemed impossible with how Freya was clamping down. Strangely, the tightness of her insides didn't actually stop him from pulling out at all, causing Vahn to extricate himself rather easily as the light slowly began to dim. He could see his own penis was glowing with a pink light that was slowly beginning to fade away as it returned to a flesh color. It was a very strange sight to behold but Vahn was too relieved at the moment to really care about the peculiar glow...</p><p>Freya, teary-eyed before, now started sobbing as if Vahn had just taken her most precious thing in a very selfish manner. This caused the tightness in his heart to compound as he tightly hugged the crying goddess, stroking her back in a comforting manner as he said, "It's okay, Freya...everything is going to be alright..." He was using his [Grooming] and [Hands of Nirvana] at their full potential, but it still took nearly ten minutes for Freya to calm down within his embrace. Vahn noticed this was around the same amount of time that it took the light to fade from where they were connected, causing him to assume her mental state had been a result of the strange phenomenon...</p><p>Now that she was feeling calmer, even though her insides felt very 'lonely', Freya hung her head and wiped away the tears before looking up into Vahn's face, stunned upon looking into his eyes. They still had their aquamarine-green coloration but there was now an almost indiscernible pink ring surrounding his pupils, something others might not notice but, being a Goddess of Beauty, Freya immediately knew what it was. She felt strangely vindicated, knowing that Vahn would have to 'suffer' in the future after he 'bullied' her in such a mean way...</p><p>Sensing the change in Freya, Vahn blinked in confusion, stroking her fair white and inexplicably soft cheek as he asked, "Are you okay...?" Vahn found Freya's wine-red eyes very captivating but he was able to resist the effect of her natural charm, expressing concern for her after she had cried for nearly ten minutes. She almost immediately nodded in response to his question, a beautiful smile spreading across her lips as she said, "I don't know what you did...it was amazing...I can't even describe how amazing it was...I..."</p><p>This reaction of her's caused Vahn to feel a great deal of relief as he chuckled lightly and surprised her with a sudden kiss. Before she could propose doing it again, Vahn stroked her silver hair and said, "It isn't something we can do that often, but I'm glad we were able to truly become one, Freya..." Following his words, Vahn pulled her tightly into his embrace and hoped that, now more than ever, she was able to feel the care, concern, and, though it hadn't been that obvious before, the love he felt for her...</p><p>(A/N: Alternate Titles: 'Vahn isn't an exhibitionist xD...','RIP Innocent Bystanders...','Vahn essentially 'fused' with Freya's insides (&gt;,...,&lt;)...!')</p><p>https://bit.ly/2XBzAYu &lt;-(p.atreon link)</p><p>paypal.me/Einlion</p><p>Discord Invite: https://discord.gg/mn5xMbE</p></main><div class="link-group"><a class="btn" href="00842.html">Previous</a><a class="btn" href="../index.html">Table of Contents</a><a class="btn" href="00844.html">Next</a></div></div><div class="right-icon theme"><input type="image" id="themeButton" src="https://i.imgur.com/PWAzExk.png" height="25"></div><div id="readpos">0%</div><script src="../js/theme.js"></script></body></html>
