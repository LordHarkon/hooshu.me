<p>Despite having claws at her throat, Aoko just raised her hands in a surrender gesture, an awkward smile on her face as she stated in a mock-casual manner, "Hey now, there is no reason to be like this. I'm sorry, okay...?"</p><p>If she went all out, Aoko would be able to extricate herself from this situation but, as it wasn't her intention to actually start a fight, she decided to try and diffuse things. Fortunately, Vahn brought a swift end to the tensions by saying in a firm yet casual tone, "Stand down. Fenrir, let go of Aoko's neck."</p><p>Artoria, Gawain, Kenshin, and Lakshmibai all pulled their swords away but, despite being told to stand down, none of them sheathed their weapons. As for Fenrir, she obediently released Aoko's neck before trotting over to her Master's side. Vahn habitually rubbed her head and ears with a wry smile on his face as he looked over at Aoko and said, "Our words were a little childish so we cannot hold you solely accountable for this situation. For the time being, let's say we set this matter to rest and let bygones be bygones...?"</p><p>Aoko was listening to Vahn's words but, at the same time, she rubbed the tiny pockmarks on her neck where Fenrir's claws had pricked her skin. With her durability and resistances, she was surprised that the rather adorable little wolf-girl was actually able to injure her. She could even take on direct fire from high-caliber rifles without sustaining any injuries so she was a little taken aback by how sharp the little girl's claws were.</p><p>In response to Vahn's compromise, Aoko returned a wry smile of her own as she said, "Sure. That sounds good. I actually wouldn't mind fighting everyone here but I don't really want to make any enemies. Sorry if I offended any of you..."</p><p>Before the conversation could progress any further, Solon interrupted by saying in a dull tone, "We should not dawdle here. If you want to talk, we should move to a more private venue. If not, I would rather you all leave the Clock Tower, preferably without returning."</p><p>Solon felt that things had been going downhill for them ever since Vahn's arrival in this world. Every time something troubling happened, he always seemed to be at the center of everything. Though it was also true that the Association had been in need of reform for a long period of time, Solon didn't really want to deal with it. Their primary concern was preserving Magecraft and preventing Mystery from fading away on the Surface. They didn't care what the families affiliated with the Association were up to, so long as it did not directly bring trouble to the Clock Tower. In hindsight, this was a big mistake but, before someone like Vahn appeared, they didn't have to worry about it...</p><p>There were several things that Vahn wanted to discuss but, knowing there were far more important things going on, he ultimately shook his head and stated, "A discussion between the Empire and the Association will take place in the near future. For now, we have other matters to deal with. I'm certain it will be more convenient for the Association to address the matter of the Barthomeloi family before things get further out of hand so we won't trouble you any further today. I'll leave the scheduling of our meeting to the Wizard Marshall."</p><p>Having expected Vahn to insist on negotiating immediately, as the Empire currently had leverage against the Association, Solon was at a momentary loss as to how they should respond. Fortunately, Zelretch had greater composure so, without missing a beat, the elder Magus smiled before saying in an aged voice, "We appreciate your consideration, Your Majesty. This matter will not take too long to resolve so I will personally alert the Edelfelt family once the details have been ironed out."</p><p>Vahn gave a curt nod in response to Zelretch's words before turning his gaze back to Solon. Though the meeting would have to wait until a later date, there was another meeting he prioritized over his own negotiations. Thus, without beating around the bush, he asked, "We trust you have contacted the Director of the Atlas Temple to arrange a meeting, yes? Da Vinci has been looking forward to the exchange so I trust that you will contact Director Oberon for us?"</p><p>Though they didn't exactly need a reminder, Solon grimaced when they heard Vahn's words. Since Merlin had made an appearance, it was necessary for them to complete their part of the agreement. This made Solon feel rather bitter as, while they had indeed wanted to discuss some things with the errant Beast of Destruction, it didn't really feel like a fair trade. Merlin was not pleasant to deal with so it made them feel frustrated knowing that the Empire would benefit while they had been forced to deal with one of the few people that grated on their nerves even more than Vahn.</p><p>Despite their frustration, Solon scrunched up their nose before saying in a chiding tone, "We do not need your reminder. I have already been in contact with the Director of the Atlas Temple. They have expressed an interest in meeting with Da Vinci as well so you only need to set the date. Now, if there is nothing else, please leave...I'm..." Solon almost mentioned how tired they were of dealing with all of this but, remembering that Zelretch was going to be even busier, they ultimately decided to hold their tongue.</p><p>Without another word, Solon waved their hand like they were swatting away a fly. This caused one of the rings on their fingers to activate, bending space around them and allowing them to depart the arena without another word.</p><p>Zelretch issued an awkward laugh in response to Solon's departure but, as he looked around at the gathered crowd, his face formed into a frown. While others might not have noticed it, he had made a point of keeping Merlin within his perception. When Solon disappeared, Merlin also vanished shortly thereafter. He didn't exactly have to worry about Merlin doing anything to Solon but, after knowing the latter for thousands of years, he couldn't help but be a little worried about leaving them alone with one of the most inexplicable existences in all realities.</p><p>Vahn was actually fully aware of Merlin's departure but, as there wasn't much he could do to stop him, he just continued to smile casually as he said, "Well then, we'll be on our way. We both have matters to attend so it is for the best we part here..."</p><p>Before Zelretch could offer to show Vahn's group out, someone else preempted him by asking in a curious tone, "Hey, you mind if I tag along? I don't really want to be involved in anything official and there were some things I wanted to talk about. I'm familiar with the Edelfelt family so they probably won't care if I drop by."</p><p>As he had already been thinking about meeting with Aoko in the near future, Vahn only took a few moments before ultimately nodding his head and saying, "I can't promise we'll have the chance to discuss everything at this time but I can't imagine Olivia and Luvia turning you away. Very well, you may accompany us. My companions might be a little tense around you but I'm certain it won't be a serious issue."</p><p>Vahn intended his words to be a reminder to both Aoko and his companions to behave but, while his entourage seemed to understand, Aoko herself began to laugh in a carefree manner before she gave him a thumbs up and said, "I'll try not to spook them again. I would rather not have that little girl's claws digging into my throat, hahahaha~"</p><p>Hearing Aoko call her a 'little girl', Fenrir's ears turned backward in an aggressive manner as her face formed into a snarl, teeth exposed. This caused Aoko to take a step back but, before things became even tenser, Vahn plopped his hand down on Fenrir's head. She didn't immediately calm down but, after a few seconds had passed, her ears became less tense, drooping slightly as she released a snort through her nose and turned away from Aoko.</p><p>With Fenrir calming down, Vahn looked toward Aoko and plainly stated, "You should choose your words with more consideration, Aoko. Despite appearances, Fenrir is already thirty-five years old. Judging people based on their appearances is a brash and inconsiderate thing to do...not everyone has a choice when it comes to their appearance..."</p><p>Aoko winced slightly after hearing Vahn's words but, rather than apologize, she asked, "Is she really older than me? That is...unfortunate. If you want, I might be able to help out?" With the Fifth Magic, it wasn't that difficult to change the appearance of others. If she allocated time from one person to another, it was possible to accelerate or reverse their time, granting perpetual youth at the expense of reverting their potential.</p><p>In response to Aoko's offer, Fenrir scrunched up her nose again as she stated in a growling tone, "I will deal with my problems on my own. I do not need the pity of other people. You should mind your own business...!"</p><p>Vahn was a little surprised by how hostile Fenrir was being but, considering Aoko was one of the few people that could actually threaten them, he could understand why she was so riled up. In her mind, anyone that was not yet 'family' was an enemy or, at the very least, a potential enemy. She had very developed instincts so it must be frustrating for her to be around someone she knew could pose a very real threat to everything they wanted to protect. In fact, it was for this reason that Vahn had left her out of the previous meetings with Solon as it was almost guaranteed that conflict would arise...</p><p>For a brief moment, Vahn considered summoning Fenrir back to Avalon via Unit Management but, as he didn't want her to think he was punishing her, he just lightly pinched the base of her ear and said, "Calm down..." in a tone only she could hear. This caused Fenrir to turn her face away once again, her breathing taking on a specific rhythm that indicated she was doing her best to calm down.</p><p>Aoko wasn't that good at dealing with other hotheaded individuals so she was feeling awkward and apologetic. However, she tried to avoid ever apologizing as, in her opinion, it was better to make up for mistakes through actions, not words. With that in mind, she decided to take Vahn's advice or, at the very least, avoid saying anything that might make the wolf girl upset. There was a part of her that really wanted to touch Fenrir's fluffy ears so, as much as possible, Aoko wanted to avoid making the girl into her enemy.</p><p>Adopting the best smile she could manage in this situation, Aoko crossed her arms and asked, "Are we just going to keep standing around here? I actually flew all the way from Japan so I'd like to get something to eat before my body gives out. Despite my looks, I'm actually a glutton, hahahaha~"</p><p>Understanding Aoko's attempts to ingratiate herself to the group by being self-deprecating, Vahn adopted a smile of his own as he answered, "That would be for the best." Then, after turning to face Zelretch, he added, "I doubt he needs to be told but make sure Merlin doesn't overstay his welcome. You'll be able to reach us by contact Olivia or by appearing near the transfer gate. On that note, let me remind you that the Empire is not entertaining uninvited guests for the time being..."</p><p>Zelretch gave an understanding nod in response to Vahn's words before tapping his cane against the ground and opening a portal behind the group. With the current state of affairs in the Clock Tower, it wasn't the best idea for Vahn's group to be walking through the campus and facilities.</p><p>---</p><p>After a few more cursory words, Vahn bade farewell to Zelretch before leading the group, sans one flowery Magus, through the portal. Aoko followed a little behind the group at first but, before they proceeded too far, Lakshmibai and Kenshin matched pace with her. Even without Vahn having to ask, they knew it would be better for someone to ease the tensions between Aoko and the group. This would normally be Fenrir's self-imposed duty but, as this was clearly not an option, they had taken it upon themselves to play the part...</p><p>With Zelretch's consideration, the group was placed just outside the localized bounded field of the Edelfelt Manor. Since there was the usual barrier preventing normal people from noticing anything amiss, their sudden appearance didn't even draw the attention of any passing pedestrians. Instead, they went on with their lives, completely unaware of the fantastical nature of the world they lived in.</p><p>It didn't take long at all for the Edelfelt Security Forces to react to the presence of Vahn's group. The first to noticed them issued an order through their earpiece that set the mansion's staff into motion like a group of highly organized ants. At the same time, Vahn could sense Olivia moving to the usual reception area, though not before she waved her hand knowingly in his direction.</p><p>By the time Vahn's group reached the main entrance, most of the servant staff had already gathered in two neat columns to greet them. This wasn't even abnormal in the Edelfelt household so Vahn just gave an appreciative nod to the group before informing the head Butler that they would be staying for dinner. Though it would be better to return to Avalon and have the meeting there, he didn't trust Aoko enough to invite her into his home, especially into the Projection. She might be an honest and forthright woman but, with the amount of power she wielded, he would rather deal with her as far away from his home as possible...</p><p>---</p><p>While Vahn and his entourage were idling at the Edelfelt mansion, there were several other events taking place, both within the Clock Tower and at the Barthomeloi family Manor.</p><p>Merlin was quite enjoying teasing Solon after more than fifteen-hundred years, much to the petite Magus' chagrin. If not for the fact they wanted more information about Vahn and his origins, Solon would never willingly deal with Merlin's presence. However, while Merlin was a lot of very frustrating things, Solon knew his word could be trusted. More than almost anyone else, with perhaps the sole exception of Alaya, Merlin was wholly dedicated to the preservation of life.</p><p>At this point, they had already discussed Vahn's origins in a very roundabout manner but, as Solon was not entirely convinced, they ultimately asked directly, "Are you certain that the Sage Emperor can really be trusted? I feel that their actions may lead to the destruction of everything, not just the Surface world..."</p><p>Rather than refute Solon's words, Merlin gave a lazy nod before answering, "If he one day decided to destroy the world, I fear there is nothing that could stop him. You may not have realized it yet, but I have already determined that it is futile to try and oppose that man. While he lacks a fate of his own, he is able to influence the fates of those around him to an extreme degree. At this point, it is already too late to try and prevent his rise so, if you're looking to me for advice, I would suggest forming an alliance instead of leading to the very destruction you want to avoid..."</p><p>Solon inhaled sharply through their nose in response to Merlin's words. They wanted to refute them and try to convince Merlin to help come up with countermeasures against Vahn but, with the former stating very plainly that it is 'futile', Solon could only grit their teeth while balling their hands into fists. From the moment they learned that Vahn was from the 'Outside', Solon had already started to feel hopeless. After all, Vahn was immune to even their Eyes of Death Perception, a form of Mystic Eyes that allowed them to even kill Gods and Greater Divine Spirits...</p><p>After calming down, Solon decided to follow up by asking, "Can you tell me why it is futile? If your words are the truth, I don't see any reason for you to keep things hidden. You know I'm not going to go around publicizing secrets to others. Tell me the truth..."</p><p>Once again, Merlin made no effort to deceive Solon with his usual flowery words. He knew Solon far better than they knew themselves as, in every past vision of the future, Merlin had seen how hard the reclusive Magus had fought to preserve humanity. In almost every timeline, Solon would, time and again, sacrifice everything in order to give humanity a fighting chance. Knowing this, Merlin gave a small nod before detailing exactly how strong Vahn was. He even revealed the existence of Alaya and the fact that Vahn was Type: Omega and had authority over all other Types, including Gaia herself.</p><p>By the time Merlin had finished his explanation, Solon felt like their brain had stopped working. It wasn't until Merlin tried to poke them with his staff that they came back to their senses, scowling in the process. However, immediately after that, Solon lowered their head and asked, "It really is futile, isn't it...? How can something like that even exist...simply ridiculous..."</p><p>Merlin waved his hand dismissively after hearing Solon's remark, saying in a lackadaisical tone, "Vahn has his quirks, but he is a good man. His ultimate goal is actually to leave this world but, as he can't just ignore the suffering of others, he is compelled to take action. Rather than try and come up with a method to defeat him, it would be better to work alongside him to make the world a better place. When he is satisfied with the progress made, he will inevitably move on from this world so why not just go with the flow~?"</p><p>Hearing Merlin's words, Solon snorted before waving their hand and pulling out a mirror from thin air. Reflected in its surface was what could only be described as a massacre, one perpetrated by a scarlet-eyed woman garbed in purple and black attire. When Merlin saw this, he began to awkwardly scratch his cheek as, while he didn't disagree with Vahn's decision, he couldn't deny it was more than a little extreme. He abhorred violence and destructive, even if he understood the necessity of such actions.</p><p>Knowing what Solon wanted to say, Merlin just shook his head before saying in a melancholic tone, "Vahn is not the type that seeks conflict. That does not mean he will avoid it, however...this is a fate that the Barthomeloi family brought upon themselves. If we want to avoid even more death, changes will need to be made within the Association. This is something you need to seriously consider as, in the upcoming negotiations, Vahn is going to offer you several terms that, for the sake of the world, you simply can't refuse..."</p><p>Solon placed the mirror showing Scáthach's slaughter back in their pocket dimension before shaking their head and releasing a tired sigh. They could already imagine, not just the Association, but every faction in the world being uprooted by Vahn. Merlin had already mentioned the fact that Vahn had the means to access the Throne of Heroes without any restrictions so there was simply no way for any group to oppose him. Even if his allies were defeated, Vahn could simply resummon them at a moment just before their deaths, effectively making everyone of central importance to the Empire immortal...</p><p>Rather than discuss Vahn any further, Solon ran their hand down their face in a self-calming gesture before looking to Merlin and, after several tense seconds, asking, "You still have the power to invade dreams, right...?"</p><p>In response to Solon's words, Merlin began to lightly chuckle before snapping his fingers. Despite Solon having defenses against sleeping spells, they watched on in silence as a field of flowers began to bloom around them. This caused their brows to twitch but, fortunately, Merlin didn't seem intent on making them relive their nightmares.</p><p>Solon found themselves at the base of a tree so vast it seemed to cover the heavens with a single branch. At the same time, a large pool of water appeared but, rather than clear blue waters, they were completely black. Solon could feel the cold liquid pass over their feet and calves but, without minding it, they continued forward until they were standing next to a large well that was more than 5m in diameter. Then, despite every fiber of their being telling them not to do it, Solon threw themselves into the well without hesitation...</p><p>(A/N: Alternate Titles: 'Red vs Blue','Scáthach doing Vahn's dirty work...','O_O...')</p><p>https://bit.ly/2XBzAYu &lt;-(p.atreon link)</p><p>paypal.me/Einlion</p><p>Discord Invite: https://discord.gg/mn5xMbE</p></main><div class="link-group"><a class="btn" href="01263.html">Previous</a><a class="btn" href="index.html">Table of Contents</a><a class="btn" href="01265.html">Next</a></div></div><div id="readpos">0%</div></body></html>
