<p>Due to the nature of the Yokai District, existing in the 'in-between' spaces on the edge of reality, the primary methods of entry were to either wander aimlessly or be invited inside. Yokai were a bit of an exception to this rule, but, unless they had 'permission' to stay inside, even they would be unable to venture within for a long period of time.</p><p>Fortunately, due to his status, Vahn had permission to freely enter and traverse the Yokai District. So long as he desired entry, Shuten, Tamamo, or Benienma would sense his intentions, opening the way for him and his guests. There, they would enjoy a 'Guests of Honor' status, allowing them to wander about without having to fear the repercussions of normal Yokai mischief. In fact, unless a member of the Empire went out of their way to stir up trouble, the Yokai within were surprisingly courteous. This was largely the result of their desire for gold, but, as the Empire had plenty to spare, it wasn't really an issue.</p><p>After spending a month within Arcueid's Marble Phantasm, most members of the Inner Sanctum were pretty content. They had originally intended to stay at the Enma-tei for a few days, but, after spending an entire month lounging about, this desire had largely diminished. Instead, they discussed the topic amongst themselves for a bit, deciding who would chaperone the children alongside Vahn.</p><p>In total, the number of people entering the Yokai District decreased from more than thirty to a much more manageable - members. This included the chaperones: Vahn, Ereshkigal, Fenrir, Hati, and Gareth. As for the children, the only ones old enough to explore freely were Isanna, Naavi, Kamiya, Daiki, and Sophia. As for others, Ulla spent a fair amount of time outside the projection, and, though she was old enough to participate, Circe hadn't allowed Penelo to attend. She could be a little overprotective, so, despite knowing it was 'safe', Circe forbade Penelo and Petra from leaving the Projection before their magical studies were complete.</p><p>While Vahn and the other chaperones would be watching over the children, two more groups would also be handling various tasks, both led by other versions of Vahn. As for their purpose, the 'support' group would be keeping tabs on some of the more powerful Yokai, preventing any accidents, while the other group would be assisting Benienma with making preparations. Though they would only be staying for a few days, it was still difficult for one humanoid yokai to prepare baths, meals, and other services for more than a dozen people. She might have a veritable army of sparrow-like Yokai, but it was hard to have too many expectations for a group that lacked hands to work with...</p><p>---</p><p>With only a few minutes remaining until they were scheduled to leave, Vahn was waiting with a large smile on his face as he saw everyone arriving in comfortable yukatas and stylish kimonos. There was something about the traditional Japanese garments that appealed to the senses, giving men a calm and dignified appearance while tremendously enhancing the natural beauty of women. Just seeing Isanna and Naavi with their hair neatly tied up made Vahn feel simultaneously proud and concerned. As for Kamiya and Daiki, the former had slowly developed into a rather 'cool' young man while the latter, in stark contrast, possessed the qualities of a 'scholar', including delicate features, sharp eyes, and a calm personality.</p><p>Vahn took great pride in all of his children, so, seeing how much they had grown, it always brought a smile to his face. Yes, he was immensely concerned about Isanna and Naavi, as they now look almost identical to their mothers, but that didn't change her love and affection for each of them. Thus, while it was a little 'overkill', there would be a primary chaperone escorting them while another followed the groups from the shadows. While he might not be able to protect them so easily later in their life, he would never risk their safety while they were still minors...</p><p>Seeing Kamiya gradually distancing himself from the group, Vahn's smile became imperceptibly wry as he vanished like a phantom from where he had been seated, appearing behind the black-haired, red-eyed, youth. His sudden disappearance had drawn the notice of nearly everyone present, but, as it wasn't exactly rare for him to vanish, none of them showed surprise. Rather, with their senses, only Daiki hadn't noticed his sudden appearance behind Kamiya.</p><p>Feeling a sudden weight on his shoulder, Kamiya straightened his back, his body becoming slightly tense as he looked back and muttered, "Chichiue..." in an uncharacteristically demure tone. He was usually a very confident and somewhat overbearing youth, largely due to the influence of Nobunaga and Mordred, so it was rare to see him with a 'thoughtful' expression on his face.</p><p>Sensing his son's internal conflict, Vahn sent a thread of calming energy into Kamiya's body before saying, "Tonight, I'd like to explore the Yokai District with you. How about it...?"</p><p>Before Kamiya could answer, Isanna adopted a pouting expression, remarking, "But I wanted to walk around with Papa..."</p><p>Without losing his smile, Vahn just sent a glance at Isanna before turning his attention to Naavi and Ereshkigal in turn. He actually had intended to accompany their group, as, in more ways than one, it was dangerous for Vanir to move about freely. Isanna, Naavi, and Daiki would all walking around the Yokai District together, so, as the largest group, Vahn was going to watch over them with Ereshkigal and Gareth.</p><p>Isanna knew she had said something selfish, so, before anyone else vocalized, she adopted an apologetic expression and said, "Sorry...I was just looking forward to walking around with Papa..."</p><p>Though she often did and said things on impulse, Isanna wasn't actually as selfish as she could have been. She was also quick to apologize for her wrongdoings, causing Vahn to return her an approving nod as he said, "We'll have plenty of time to explore later. Tonight, I want to spend some time with Kamiya. You should focus on enjoying the evening with your brother and sister. When you return to the Enma-tei, I'll have a surprise prepared for everyone I didn't have a chance to accompany, okay?"</p><p>Without arguing, Isanna nodded her head in understanding. She was happy spending time with her siblings, so, while it would have been more fun to walk around with her Papa, it would still be a fun evening.</p><p>---</p><p>Once everyone had gathered, Vahn opened the 'entrance' to the Yokai District by simply having each group stand outside a random room. Then, after sending a signal to Tamamo, he opened to door to reveal the interior of a small shrine. It was a rather strange sight for those who had never witnessed it, adding a certain mysticism and charm to the moon-kissed lands on the opposite side.</p><p>Before sending anyone through, Vahn reminded, "You are free to explore, but, no matter what, you have to stay with your chaperone. It is possible to get lost in an instant if you aren't paying attention, so, if you do get lost, find a place to rest and wait for someone to come pick you up. Remember, the entities inside are also our people. Some may look and behave in strange manners, but that is not an excuse to look down on or insult them. If you feel as though they are antagonizing or offending you, it is not your place to settle the dispute. The day will come when you each have authority and power to wield. For now, it is our responsibility to deal with such things. Do I make myself clear...?"</p><p>As all of his children were very obedient, Vahn couldn't help but smile widely when they all nodded at nearly the exact same moment. He was very proud of the people they were becoming, and, while it was largely due to the efforts of their mothers, it made him feel gratified as their father...</p><p>After waiting for everyone else to depart, leaving on him and Kamiya remaining, Vahn lightly pat his son on the shoulder, asking, "Want to talk about it?"</p><p>Hearing his Chichiue's question, Kamiya released a sigh unbefitting a child. Then, with a small frown on his face, he honestly answered, "Aneue promised to come with me tonight. When I went to ask if she was ready, she told me she was busy even though she was just sitting around with her friends..."</p><p>Even before Kamiya had finished speaking, Vahn realized what the problem was. His son had always been rather 'fond' of his older sister. This was largely due to the fact that Mordred had helped take care of him ever since he was a baby, changing his diapers, bathing him, and doting on him nearly every day. She also took an active role in his education, teaching him what it meant to be a man that was capable of leading other men. He was the 'eldest son' within their familiar hierarchy, so, due to her unique quirks, Mordred spent much of her free time looking after Kamiya.</p><p>Vahn was aware of the puppy love that Kamiya had developed for Mordred, but, after discussing it with Artoria and Nobunaga, he decided to let the matter run its course. They weren't blood-related, and, before Mordred began to 'aggressively' pursue him, Vahn wouldn't have been too troubled if they ultimately ended up together. While some might see it as 'grooming', Mordred possessed no such intentions towards her step-sibling, so, if something did develop between them, it would have been the result of Kamiya's adolescence, not direct manipulation.</p><p>Put simply, Kamiya, much like his 'arch-rival', Daiki, was a bit of a sis-con. He had always been a little jealous of the attention Daiki received from his Onee-sans, so, with Mordred treating him well since before he could even remember, it wasn't difficult to understand why he would be attached to her.</p><p>Understanding the crux of the matter, Vahn decided to be honest with his son, explaining, "While it was wrong of her to make a promise and not keep it, Mordred has experienced more than a month since this afternoon. She, and the others, entered a special area where time flowed much faster than within the castle. For me, more than seven months have passed in a similar amount of time, so, while I may be a poor substitute for your sister, I'd like it if we spent some time together."</p><p>Hearing his Chichiue's explanation, Kamiya was a little confused, but, knowing time flowed in many different ways, he ultimately nodded his head. He didn't really understand it, but, as his Chichiue was always very honest with them, Kamiya knew more than a month had passed for his Aneue. He knew a lot could happen in a single month, so, while he was still a little upset, it was never boring to spend time with his Chichiue.</p><p>After coming to terms with what had happened, Kamiya looked up at his father, asking, "Can I really choose where we go? What if I want to go exploring in the mountains or something...?"</p><p>Without even having to think about his response, Vahn smiled in amusement as he said, "You know the policy of the Empire. So long as you do not infringe upon the rights of others, you are free to live and act as you please. While you are still too young to make such decisions on your own, I will never discourage you from exploration when we are together. Even if you wanted to fly up to the moon or dive to the bottom of the ocean, I would follow along to keep you safe."</p><p>Toward the end of his statement, Vahn ruffled his son's hair, an even bigger grin on his face as he said, "You are a Mason, the son of the Sage Dragon Emperor. Possessing a free spirit and the desire to protect others is the benchmark of our family. Now, lead the way. Tonight is your night, my son. Whenever you wish to go, I will follow..."</p><p>(A/N: Alternate Titles: 'Guests of Honor','Is Kamiya's 'true name' actually Genji...!?','*I'll make a man out of you begins to play in the background*')</p><p>https://bit.ly/2XBzAYu &lt;-(p.atreon link)</p><p>paypal.me/Einlion</p><p>Discord Invite: https://discord.gg/Jwa8PKh</p></main><div class="link-group"><a class="btn" href="01504.html">Previous</a><a class="btn" href="../index.html">Table of Contents</a><a class="btn" href="01506.html">Next</a></div></div><div id="readpos">0%</div></body></html>
