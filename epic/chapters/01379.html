<p>Though it wasn't impossible for her to kill Demons, one of Kenshin's mission objectives involved the capture of their target. Da Vinci was developing a method to detect the unique energy within Demonic entities, updating the Companions' systems to be able to emulate the function of Pure Eyes. She had originally tried to study Jeanne's and Galahad's eyes but, without removing them and performing a detailed analysis, this was an ultimately futile endeavor.</p><p>Once Yami returned carrying the [Demon Sealing Jar], Kenshin placed it within a special satchel that used Imaginary Number Space to store objects without any time passing. It was still a work in progress but, with Interspatial Artifacts unable to store organic material, it was the best they could do until Da Vinci created a new prototype.</p><p>To thank Yami for its hard work, Kenshin affectionately rubbed the obedient Companion's cheeks before turning to the woman strapped to the table. There, Hikari was using magic known as 'High Heal', derivative magic that had been developed after researching items Vahn had produced with his unique ability. It used a completely different logic than standard Magecraft but, while the cost was several times higher than normal healing, the effects far exceeding the capabilities of modern healing spells.</p><p>In less than twenty seconds, the woman strapped to the table had both of her legs restored so, to show her gratitude, Kenshin mussed Hikari's fluffy fur while muttering, "It seems I am indebted to the two of you once again~."</p><p>Though the majority of third generation Companions were capable of speech, most still opted to communicate using cute sounds. Thus, in response to Kenshin's words, Hikari rubbed its head against Kenshin's palm, a happy mewl escaping its lips. At the same time, Yami jumped up to her shoulder, rubbing its head against her cheek without minding the mask covering Kenshin's face.</p><p>While this was occurring, the three conscious prisoners were staring at Kenshin with abject terror visible on their faces. Though they hoped the mask-wearing woman had come to save them, they, like many others, had come to fear the forces of the Empire. It didn't matter how many people they rescued as, from the perspective of the majority, the Empire was to blame for everything that was happening. Prior to Vahn's announcement, they had lived in ignorant bliss, wasting their lives away in the pursuit of personal gain at the expense of the planet so, no matter the kindness they were shown, most people hated the Empire to the core.</p><p>Kenshin had become accustomed to people failing to express their gratitude so, after treating the woman on the table, she looked towards the three cowering women, stating, "You will be safer if you live closer to the food distribution centers. The Empire is slowly expanding its influence to all regions. Times are tough but, if you stay resolute, you will find peace and prosperity in due time."</p><p>Hearing Kenshin's words, one of the women began to tremble in frustration and anger but, due to the fear she was experiencing, words completely escaped her. The Empire was known for striking down dissidence without hesitation so, despite a strong urge to lash out and lambast Kenshin for the crimes of her Emperor, the trio could only shed tears. As for Kenshin, she flicked her wrist in a casual manner but, from the perspective of the girls, she hadn't moved at all. When they finally realized what had happened, their bindings had been cut and, as if she had never been there in the first place, Kenshin had disappeared...</p><p>---</p><p>After returning to the relay point, Kenshin removed her mask to take a breath of fresh air before stating in a commanding tone, "Report." In response, Nora gave a curt salute before explaining, "Squads Seven and Eight had to deal with a riot instigated by religious dissidents. Some of the people complained about the quality and quantity of the rations they were given so Theralise ran a cursory scan of the crowd, using logic and reasoning to try and control the crowd. This resulted in a riot breaking out but, after apprehending those responsible for riling up the crowd, the rest calmed down quickly."</p><p>Hearing Nora's report, Kenshin couldn't help but release a sigh as this was a common occurrence as of late. Since those living away from the food distribution centers were generally hardliners and small factions, they sent agents to gather food from the Empire-controlled facilities. As the Empire only gave people enough food to sustain themselves and their immediate family, using a series of detailed scans to keep track of distribution, the total amount they obtained wasn't nearly enough for all the rebels they intended to feed.</p><p>As a result, forces in direct opposition to the Empire, as if the people they were targetting were beneath them, freely robbed others, often committing other heinous acts in order to support their personal agenda. This was additional evidence proving that the change introduced by Vahn was necessary as, with people defaulting to this type of behavior, it was a testament to just deep the corruption of society had become.</p><p>Since she wasn't smart enough to consider the finer details, Kenshin could only do what she did best; defeat her foes and protect the people that required her help. With this in mind, she gave a curt nod to Nora before stating, "We will expose those with relations to external factions, denying them access to further supplies unless they are willing to adhere to Common Law. If they choose to ignore their own words, they will be cut off and exiled."</p><p>Without questioning Kenshin's orders, Nora gave another salute while exclaiming, "Understood!" in a resolute. She, like nearly every Homunculus serving under Vahn, had come to admire him far more than something as base as an Emperor. To them, he was basically their Savior and God, an idea that became even more prominent after he obtained a Divinity. Though it was kept a 'secret' from him, a considerable number of Homunculi even gathered together to celebrate their God in a rather 'improper' manner, often after hard training sessions.</p><p>With Kenshin's own Loyalty to Vahn being unquestionable, those that had trained under her had been influenced by her teachings and behavior. Thus, as their Egos developed, they had become rather zealous in their views, especially when seeing how those serving directly under Vahn, such as Gareth, improved. She had quickly reached a point where they couldn't defeat her without the combined effort of more than twenty Homunculi, a testament to how much she had grown since the start of their joint training...</p><p>After regrouping with Squads 7 and 8, Kenshin stood atop the high wall surrounding the food production facility while Nora listened to the oral reports of the two Captains. There, she saw a veritable ocean of people gathered around, their numbers reaching close to two-million, more than half of which only lingered around for free supplies and food. Though this wasn't necessarily a bad thing, as that was the purpose of the facility, the number of dissidents intermixed among the general populace led to riots breaking out almost every day.</p><p>Kenshin was reminded of the rampant slums that had been an issue during her era, lawless areas where the poor and downtrodden intermixed amongst criminals to take advantage of the various Lords governing the land. They were often a breeding bed of violent crime and, though she had done her best to provide jobs to those inhabiting them, a surprising number of people opted to just leech benefits while doing the least amount of work possible. This current gathering was no different as, without police to enforce order; theft, robbery, murder, extortion, and sexual assault were all too common...</p><p>Since there were tens of thousands of people gathered in order to receive their weekly food and supplies, a considerable number of people noticed Kenshin atop the walls. Based on her armor, it was easy to deduce she was a high ranking officer within the Imperial forces so, from the moment she appeared, even those frustrated at the long lines became docile. Even without things like the internet to help spread information, most of the residents around food production facilities knew what each armor color represented so none of them wanted to caused trouble while Kenshin was around.</p><p>Unfortunately, this wasn't an adequate method to maintain order as, if they kept someone with black armor present at all times, people would gradually become accustomed to their presence. In time, those with lingering thoughts of dissidence would feel emboldened and, after a series of petty crimes, they would eventually resort to something extreme just to spite the person watching over them. The only real solution was extreme violence but, as this was against the policies of the Empire, the best they could do is restore order when things got especially out of hand.</p><p>Eventually, the community itself would rally behind influential figures in an effort to maintain order but, until people realize things weren't going to return to how they were, the current chaos would continue. According to Ark's estimates, the current transitory period, acceptance, would last for a total of three years. Once things reached that point, people would begin trying to rebuild society in accordance with the new order. This phase would take upwards of fifty years if left alone but, by building the Supercolonies and Sanctuary Cities, the Empire could reduce the time to around ten and twenty years depending on the damage caused by Angra Mainyu and other forces.</p><p>Kenshin didn't have the best understanding of the Empire's plans but, in order to make sure their enemies weren't able to intervene, she hardened her heart to do whatever it took to ensure each phase was a success. Thus, much to the chagrin of the people who had gathered to receive their supplies, she activated a communication device that transmitted her voice throughout the entire slum-like settlement. From there, her forces went around forcibly marking those who had ties with external factions, warning them against causing trouble in the future.</p><p>By marking those responsible for the interruption of service, the community itself would feel compelled to take action. Though this effectively turned the people against each other, it also promoted the idea that the Empire's property should be protected. After all, without a supply chain to provide goods and services, the only reliable method to obtain food, medicine, and other important goods was by relying on the Empire.</p><p>Eventually, a clear divide would exist between those advocating for the benefits of the Empire and those in direct opposition to it. Since those who fell in line would receive greater benefits than those sewing discord, more people would develop the mentality that it was better to simply give in to the Empire's rule. After all, the Common Law would still apply to them so, at any given moment, a raid could occur on the settlement they were associated with, wiping them out in an instant...</p><p>It had never been Vahn's intention to conquer the world but, in order to preserve as many lives as possible, he was compelled to do so. Though his means might be considered underhanded, they were the most effective method to shift the mentality of people without directly oppressing them. Since the only other alternative was to allow them to victimize each other, often at the expense of those that simply wanted to live a peaceful lifestyle, it was necessary to bring those seeking order together in order to repel those clinging to the past.</p><p>With one side having unlimited military power, infinite energy, and inexhaustible supplies, it was only a matter of time before the Empire extinguished all other forces. Though some communities were bound to form outside of the Empire-controlled territories, they would still be bound by the Common Law so it didn't particularly matter how they chose to live. After all, Vahn believed that everyone should be able to live as they pleased, so long as it wasn't at the expense or detriment of those around them...</p><p>(A/N: Alternate Titles: 'Da Vinci's influence is extreme','Zealots can be scary...','Imagine, a world where your actions have consequences.
