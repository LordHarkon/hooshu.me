<p>Okay guys, this one is going to be pretty important. A lot of changes will be happening with the new year as I want to fix a lot of things to make the reading experience more stable for my readers. I'll be returning to scheduled releases once again (assuming nothing prevents me from doing so), but the overall chapter length is going to be pulled back.</p><p>I was originally writing 2k word chapters but, as a result of trying to fit more story into each chapter, I'm averaging around 3.3-3.5k these days. This makes each chapter a bit of a chore so I'm hoping I can increase the overall amount by reducing the average length once again. With this change, I'll be able to write up to five chapters per day so things should be picking up a fair amount.</p><p>Now, before I press my nose to the grindstone once again, I need to make good on a promise I made previously. With this in mind, I'll be using today to try and finish up Fenrir's Journey so there will be a mass release of sorts until it has finally been brought to an end. I'm hoping to finish it all today but, depending on my family's plans, I may end up leaving in the afternoon to go celebrate the new year with them. If this happens, I'll finish up FJ tomorrow and then officially start the new schedule the following day.</p><p>Last but not least, I'll only be releasing these updates if something major happens in the future so, if you want all the important news as it happens, please consider joining the Discord. This will enable you to know when each chapter comes out immediately after its posted and, if anything happens to me, I always try to let the people on the server know.</p><p>Well, that's about it for this end of the year update. Thanks for reading my novels! Without the help of some of you amazing people, I would not be able to do this. While it doesn't exactly pay well, I'm quite fond of writing so I'd like to turn it into my career at some point. This has been important for helping me build a foundation as an author so I appreciate the opportunity I have been given. Thank you all.</p><p>Sincerely,</p><p>Ein's Left Foot</p></main><div class="link-group"><a class="btn" href="01280.html">Previous</a><a class="btn" href="../index.html">Table of Contents</a><a class="btn" href="01282.html">Next</a></div></div><div id="readpos">0%</div></body></html>
