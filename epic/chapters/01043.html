<p>Having sensed the disappearance of Nobunaga, Vahn squinted his eyes slightly, even as he continued towards Rin's room with a steadfast gait. If he wasn't wrong, she was probably going to follow after Fenrir to make sure the latter didn't find herself in a situation she couldn't deal with. Though the odds seemed equally as high that she was just going out to 'play' for the evening, Vahn didn't think Nobunaga was that loose of a woman. In fact, if his intuition wasn't wrong, she seemed to have a preference for other women since she dressed like a man and acted in an overbearing manner. At the very least, she seemed to be a very 'open-minded' person who showed no discernible signs of shame or modesty...</p><p>Deciding he would follow his own words and deal with Nobunaga later, Vahn quickly found himself standing outside of Rin's door. Unlike how it normally ought to be, as Rin was fond of her privacy, there was a line of light cutting through the dark hallway, the source belonging to the lamps within Rin's room. Since there was no way Rin would have made such a mistake, Vahn concluded that Nobunaga had gone out of her way to crack the door on her way out. This allowed a few 'agonized' moans to carry into the corridor, each sounding like muted whimpers that caused Vahn to feel like an even bigger 'asshole' than before...</p><p>Knowing Rin would probably refuse to let him in if he knocked, Vahn ran his hand along his forehead before running his fingers through his own hair in a self-calming gesture. Then, reminding himself that Rin was not only his friend, but the first person he had come to care about in this foreign world, Vahn pushed open the door before stepping across its threshold. This didn't go unnoticed by Rin as, even though she had been more than a little distracted, that didn't mean she wasn't paying attention to her surroundings. Seeing who had entered into her room this time around, Rin's already flushed face turned a sickly shade of red as she hid her body under the blankets and said, "Don't come in...go away..."</p><p>Hearing her words, Vahn's feet came to a sudden stop as he gently stated, "Rin...I'm sorry. The way I've treated you...it wasn't right. You may never forgive me, but I am determined to help you get through this. Please, let me help you..." At the end of his words, Vahn tried to take another step forward but Rin instantly brought him to a stop as she suddenly sat up on her bed and shouted, "Get out of my room! I don't need your help, you stupid jerk! Why don't you send your stupid Servant back up instead...you...you bastard...!" Though the intensity of her outburst had started off strong, Rin's eyes began to tear up in the latter half. Then, as if she didn't want her face to be seen, she hugged her knees tightly before hanging her head to conceal her expression.</p><p>Vahn felt even worse after seeing Rin like this, cursing his past self for once again bringing harm to someone he had cared about. This wasn't the first time something like this had happened yet, no matter how much Vahn swore he would never allow another repeat of the same kind of incident, Rin was only the latest in a long line of his mistakes. Unfortunately, it didn't seem as if she were willing to talk through things as, shortly after she hid her face, Rin's hair began to change colors at the roots. From atop her head, a black crown that had three curved prongs cut through her hair before her clothes dissolved away, this time forming into Ereshkigal's raiment nigh-instantaneously.</p><p>When 'Rin', now Ereshkigal, looked back up at him, her eyes were still red with tears as she coldly stated, "Rin doesn't want to see you right now...she says not to worry though, as she will feel better by morning. Make sure to prepare a big meal as an apology..." Each sentence that left Eereshkiga's lips was concise and to the point, showing that she was simply conveying Rin's message and had no intentions to converse with him. Vahn, however, wasn't willing to just leave things as they were so he hardened his expression, asking, "Why are you and Ishtar even participating within the Holy Grail War? What wish could two Goddesses, daughters of one of the most powerful Gods, have?"</p><p>In response to this, Ereshkigal remained silent and just continued to stare back at him with her maroon-red eyes. It wasn't until nearly a full minute had passed, causing Vahn to nearly 'demand' an answer that she finally answered, "I just wanted to see...the world beyond the reverse side. I hear the cries of the dead, calling out, grasping at a life that has already been extinguished...if possible...I want...to..." This was as far as Ereshkigal got before closing her eyes and beginning her transformation into Ishtar. Before this process could complete, however, Ereshkigal began shaking her head a little violently before opening her eyes and revealing an aqua-blue coloration.</p><p>Looking back at Vahn, Rin's brows furrowed deeply as she anxiously muttered, "I told you to leave. Your presence is only making things worse! Don't you understand, Ishtar is a Goddess of War, Lust, Sex, and Beauty. I can't resist her influence if you're still around...!" Then, before Vahn could get out a word of his own, Rin added, "Vahn, I'm not angry at you anymore. Just give me a bit of time to cool my head and things will go back to normal. You don't have to do something you're not willing to do just because you pity me. Just...just go away..." Following these words, Rin put her head down again but Vahn could hear her breaths, each containing a muffled sob that she tried to suppress.</p><p>Knowing he was in a very precarious position, one which may even result in Rin hating him, Vahn found it nearly impossible to say anything. However, remembering the convictions that had taken him a little too long to gather, Vahn knew he couldn't just run away again. Taking another step forward, an action that caused Rin's frown to deepen even further, Vahn did his best to remain calm as he stated, "Rin...I won't lie to you. I'm...terrified..."</p><p>Hearing Vahn's words, Rin's eyes began to well up with even more tears but, before she could misunderstand any further, Vahn's expression became serious as he added, "Not of being with you. I'm terrified of all of this...! This, this world, being separated from my home, not knowing when I'll ever reunite with my family! I'm horrified at the prospect that, by the time I'm finally able to return, I won't even be the same person they loved anymore! It feels like, at any given moment, everything I'm trying to accomplish is just going to break, shattering into tiny pieces that I can never put back together...!"</p><p>Vahn's outburst hadn't stopped Rin's tears but they had managed to stymy the flow a bit as she sheepishly muttered, "You don't-." Without waiting for her to finish her sentence, Vahn shook his head fervently before saying, "You're wrong, Rin. Because, no matter how scared I am of losing everything, the thing I'm scared about the most right now is watching you break down because of a mistake I made. Even if you come to hate and resent me, I could never live with myself if I just pretended nothing was wrong...!" At this point, even Vahn's eyes had started to tear up so, even though Rin wanted to tell him to leave, she found the words stuck in her throat...</p><p>For several long seconds, silence dominated the room as the tensions within began to increase to the point any sudden 'shock' could cause everything to shatter apart. Fortunately, just as Vahn's own anxiety was about to reach a critical point, Rin muttered under her breath in a voice that she likely didn't intend for him to hear. She sounded exceptionally tired, even though her voice was tinged with the peculiar 'hotness' that only a woman in a deep state of arousal could manage. As to the purpose behind her soliloquy, Vahn knew exactly who she was talking about when Rin muttered, "Why am I always drawn to the idiotic hero types...haaaaaaa..."</p><p>After her self-admonishment, Rin squeezed her legs a little tighter as she looked back up at Vahn and barely squeaked out, "You can stay..." With these words still lingering in the air, Vahn wasted no time in taking several steps forward, only stopping when he was at the side of Rin's bed. She had been following his approach with her eyes, apprehension and expectation visible within as her complexion became progressively ruddy. At this point, her neck and shoulders also had the subtle hint of blush present, the result of Rin's fair complexion betraying her...</p><p>Seeing that she made no attempt to stop his advance, Vahn reached out with his hand, cupping Rin's cheek with his palm as he said, "I do not love you...but, I will make you feel loved to the point that you will be patient with me as I learn to love you for real. I'm sorry for being such an asshole, but I need time..."</p><p>Rin gave an unexpected laugh in response to his words, sounding almost like an involuntary spit take before she rested her cheek again his hand and complained, "There is such a thing as being too honest, Vahn...you doofus..." Then, after extending her hand forward and placing it atop his chest, she showed a genuine smile before adding, "Your heart is racing almost as fast as mine...at least you aren't completely hopeless..." Though he didn't know what she meant by her words, Vahn took them as permission as he leaned forward and gave Rin an exploratory kiss to gauge her reaction...</p><p>Without missing a beat, Rin deftly linked both of her arms around his neck before continuing the kiss of her own volition. In truth, she knew that Vahn didn't love her as, over the time they had spent together, it was easy to see that his mind was constantly focused on memories of his home. Though he had gotten better after Fenrir's arrival, it was more like he used her as a means to project his tensions without facing them directly. Since she also knew that he had a 'plethora' of women, including goddesses, it would be impossible for them to have a committed relationship. His existence was simply too big for her to even begin harboring the intention of keeping him to herself. However, even if it was for a short while, Rin wanted to be a part of his existence...knowing full well it would never bring back what she had lost.</p><p>After a long and passionate kiss, ending with Vahn leaning over a completely naked Rin, the latter was left breathing heavily as she bashfully moved her hands to cover her breasts. Since they weren't all that small, Vahn found this reaction of her's both adorable and confusing at the same time. However, as it seemed to be a common concern for many of the women he had met, Vahn traced his right palm along the left side of Rin's body before bending down and peppering the tender region beneath her clavicle. Then, slowly but surely, Vahn worked his way down until Rin naturally moved aside her hand and allowed him access to the small rose-bud she had previously concealed. Though he didn't bite down on it, Vahn lightly nibbled the sensitive spot, eliciting a twitching groan from Rin as she tightly clenched his hair...</p><p>Since she was already 'more' than ready, either as the result of Nobunaga's or Ishtar's efforts, Vahn didn't want to leave Rin hanging for much longer. As he continued to push her towards even greater heights, causing the confused Magus to enter a state of panic and confusion, Vahn quickly removed his clothes using the 'equip' function of his Inventory. This was something that went completely unnoticed by Rin as her toes curled up, even as her legs pushed against the covers as if she were trying to kick them away. By the time she was coming down and feeling a state of moderate bliss, Vahn was already prying open her rather plump thighs and taking in the sight of her messy garden. It might have been pure coincidence, but it was easy to see that Rin either shaved recently or made a habit of properly grooming the thin mat of hair that grew in a neat clump above her palpitating entrance...</p><p>Coming back to her senses, Rin wiped away the sweat from her brow before turning her eyes downward in what could only be described as a 'haphazzard' manner. This was due to the fact that, regardless of the image she had formed in her mind, nothing could have prepared her for the 'reality' of her current situation. Though Vahn had reduced his previously 'monstrous' size to a modest 25cm, it was still a terrifying sight for the rather petite Rin to behold. This was due to the fact that, not only was it larger than she had expected, but the overall thickness gave her the impression it would tear her apart if he tried to wedge in into her...</p><p>Since Rin wasn't a virgin, and her entrance was pulsing hungrily, Vahn didn't waste much time with additional foreplay, placing the tip of his glans against her steamy cavern without much thought. This sent Rin into panic mode, however, as she somehow managed to put strength into her exhausted body, quickly shrinking away as she exclaimed, "What do you think you're doing!? Use a condom...!" in a shrill squeak. This reaction of her's caught Vahn by surprise as, though he knew what a condom was, he had never actually worn one before. He had the ability to 'choose' when he wanted to impregnate someone so it had never been something the girls around him required before...</p><p>Seeing Van's expression, Rin misconstrued it as 'disappointment', causing her heart to throb painfully within her chest since Vahn, as she often described him, was stupidly handsome. His expression made her heart feeling like it was going to break so, before Vahn even had to explain the 'unique' qualities of his semen, Rin swallowed hard before saying, "Fine...but if I get pregnant, you can't make any more excuses. Even if you run around the world causing trouble, you have to promise you will take care of me and...and our child..."</p><p>Though there was no way he would impregnate Rin, at least at this point in time, Vahn gave an 'understanding' nod before saying, "One of the most important things to me is being a good father. There isn't a force in existence that could stand in the way of me taking care of my kids..." As these words left his mouth, Vahn felt a small twinge of pain in his chest as, even though he meant every word, the truth of the matter was that he couldn't see his other children right now. Though they wouldn't even register that he had been gone, it was an undeniable truth that his own weakness prevented him from being the father he wanted to be...</p><p>As she had heard both the sincerity in Vahn's words, followed by the 'pain' in his gaze, Rin knew that he must be thinking about the family he left behind in his previous world. She chose not to point out the inherent flaw in his claim, however, and instead inched a bit closer to him before taking a deep breath and leaning back. This immediately brought Vahn's focus back to her, something that caused Rin to smile as it was strangely fulfilling to have him actually pay attention to her for once. At least for this one moment, she was important enough to dominate his attention, allowing her to become the central focus of his overbearingly large existence...</p><p>Without any further delays, Vahn's glans once again found their way to Rin's steamy entrance, now producing an even greater volume of love juices than before she had pulled away. It was easy to see that the excitement, or perhaps worry, associated with getting pregnant was making Rin's body react even more. Thus, without any major difficulties, Vahn sank his hips forward as Rin released sharply inhaled a breath that didn't seem quite enough as her body became rigid due to the unexpectedly hot member invading her depths. It quickly passed her most sensitive spots before, in a manner that Rin could only describe as ruthless, hammering into the deepest parts of her forbidden cave...</p><p>With her legs trembling and an overwhelming wave of pleasure spreading through her body, Rin crossed her arms over her eyes and focused on her breathing as Vahn patiently waited for her to relax. At the same time, however, he used his hands to trace the side's of Rin's abdomen, sending gentle waves of Source Energy into her body. Not only was he increasing her sensitivity but, as it would be a waste to pass up the opportunity, Vahn used the short intermission to help refine Rin's magic circuits further. As these were closely related to the various nerve clusters within the body, Rin only felt an increase in her body's tensions as a comfortable, yet all-encompassing pleasure filled her up as if she were previously an empty container...</p><p>Though he had been paying close attention to the state of her body, Vahn noticed that Rin was giving into her blissful state a little 'too much'. This immediately caused an alarm bell to go off in the back of his mind but, before he could take any action to prevent it, Rin's hair immediately transitioned from black to blond. The trembling in her body almost immediately ceased, though this proved to be a momentary reprieve as a much more powerful and violent shaking replaced it. When she moved her arms away from her eyes, Vahn resisted the urge to produce a wry smile s a pair of maroon eyes stared back at him. He had no idea how the senses between Rin, Ishtar, and Ereshkigal were shared but it was obvious by the latter's expression she had been taken by surprise...</p><p>As a dreadful aura began to spread through the room, Ereshkigal surprised Vahn as, instead of throwing curses at him, she actually wrapped her legs around his waist before staring blankly into space and muttering, "How dare you do this to me, Sister...very well, if this is how it is to be, I will not falter. Come, my kin, now we shall be together until our deaths..." As these words left her lips, Ereshkigal's eyes regained a bit of their clarity as she gazed down at where they were connected before sheepishly adding, "Please be gentle..."</p><p>(A/N: Alternate Titles: 'Baka, baka, baaaaakaaaa...!','The fucks a condom...!? -Some Unimportant Prince','This is clearly entrapment of the highest degree...')</p><p>https://bit.ly/2XBzAYu &lt;-(p.atreon link)</p><p>paypal.me/Einlion</p><p>Discord Invite: https://discord.gg/mn5xMbE</p></main><div class="link-group"><a class="btn" href="01042.html">Previous</a><a class="btn" href="../index.html">Table of Contents</a><a class="btn" href="01044.html">Next</a></div></div><div id="readpos">0%</div></body></html>
