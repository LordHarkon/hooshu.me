<p>Following a rather relaxing rest period with the three girls, Vahn decided to strike while the iron was hot. Now that he knew there was even more to the Quest function than he had previously realized, the first thing he did was organize a gathering with everyone to explain his 'revelations'. This also included Da Vinci, even though he had to go retrieve her from the Einzbern Castle. She had slowly been converting it into a factory after Merlin had morphed the surrounding Bounded Field into a pseud-projection, slightly different from the one around Avalon.</p><p>Since the Einzbern Castle existed on the Surface, rather than in a Sub-Texture of the World, it was a lot harder to create a projection as, even with an Artificial Leyline, there simply wasn't enough mana to power it. As a result, only the 'factory' and a few other sections of the castle existed within the Projection. Da Vinci used this a second Workshop of sorts, even though the primary purpose of her time there was to increase the production of Companions and test a few of her other experiments.</p><p>With a time-dilation of 4:1, she could produce as many as 48,000 Companions in a single day, assuming she had the requisite resources to do so. As there was no need to create so many, at least for the time being, the actual production was closer to 1,000 per day, giving her ample time to innovate and develop newer models. Still, after seeing several thousand Companions wandering the rather solemn halls, Vahn felt like he had wandered into a dreamscape of sorts. As if to emphasize this, he had a veritable flock of adorable little creatures following after him by the time he reached Da Vinci's Factory. Some had even clung to his body, riding him as they produced adorable mewling sounds and other squeak-like noises...</p><p>After retrieving Da Vinci and returning to the Ivory Castle, it wasn't long before Vahn had everyone together inside of the Dining Hall, Companions included. At this point, even Paracelsus and Tristana had several Companions living with them, serving as simple assistants as they awaited the birth of their new owners. Since there were now a few thousand Homunculi in the castle, Paracelsus had slowed the production of his own, taking special care to make sure they would be able to live easy lives when they were finally 'born'. Even then, there were only a few weeks until the fateful moment, something Paracelsus had been looking forward to quite a bit.</p><p>What Vahn found most curious was the fact that, while Paracelsus was enthused about the birth of his Homunculi, there was actually another bundle of life that they had yet to announce. Since they had been living together for months now, often spending their entire days together, it wasn't too much of a surprise when Vahn discovered that Tristana was pregnant. What did surprise him was the fact that neither of them seemed to have realized it, as Tristana was only around two weeks pregnant at the time of the gathering. Though he wanted to talk about the Quests and the future direction of the Empire, Vahn couldn't help but open the conversation by smiling in amusement as he stated, "Paracelsus, Tristana, congratulations."</p><p>As could be expected, the two were rather confused by the sudden congratulatory remark, causing Tristana to furrow her brows as she asked, "What is this about?" Being a moderately capable Magus, Tristana's intuition alerted her to the fact that Vahn's congratulations were mostly directed toward her. As she rarely even saw him, she couldn't help but wonder what he was up to, especially after gathering everyone together like this. What she never would have expected was Vahn showing a surprised expression, accented with a touch of confusion, as he asked, "Do you really not know...?"</p><p>Feeling annoyed at Vahn's question, Tristana's expression turned rather dour and, if not for the fact the former was an Emperor, she would have lashed out at him. Fortunately, Paracelsus was always very calm and, shortly after he heard Vahn's words, he surprised Tristana by grabbed her wrist and taking her pulse. This caused her to fluster a bit as, though she didn't consider herself shy, they were currently surrounded by some rather high-profile and intimidating individuals.</p><p>Before Tristana could extricate her hand from Paracelsus' rather delicate looking fingers, the golden-eyed man showed an expression of genuine surprise that quickly turned into a smile. Even without asking, Tristana had started to realize what Vahn's comment was related to and, remembering how she had been feeling sick since a few days ago, she began to feel very anxious. At the same time, the rest of the people sitting around the table seemed to realize what Vahn's words meant, causing Nobunaga to be the first to say, "Oh? I figured the next woman to get pregnant would be that drill-haired gorilla."</p><p>Nobunaga's remark caused Rin to nearly choke on her tea, performing a spit take of sorts as Luvia had often called her a gorilla in the past. Hearing someone refer to her 'former' rival in such a way was rather entertaining but, considering the situation, she tried to keep calm. She also understood the implication in Nobunaga's words and, as Vahn had never officially announced it, asked, "Are you also pregnant, Nobunaga...?" This time, it was Vahn's turn to smile, explaining in a rather chipper tone of voice, "Nobunaga is around three weeks pregnant at this point. As for Tristana, she seems to be around two weeks into her pregnancy. If they both stayed inside the Projection, there is a good chance their deliveries would be around the same time."</p><p>Hearing Vahn comment on her pregnancy so casually, Nobunaga's face became a little red as she complained, "Hey, you lug-head. Don't discuss such things so openly." Then, as the cat was already out of the bag, Nobunaga turned to look at Rin, answering, "Yeah, I'm carrying this idiot's child. In the future, I might bother you a bit. Sorry in advance." Though she knew Sakura wasn't Rin's actual daughter, Nobunaga had a good impression of their mother-daughter relationship. She felt that Rin would be able to help teach her the things she needed to know as, while Iris was also a good choice, the latter was somewhat airheaded compared to the serious Rin.</p><p>Though it was somewhat awkward, Rin managed a smile in response to Nobunaga's words before politely stating, "Of course. I believe Sakura-chan and Mordred will be good big sisters as well..." As could be expected, Mordred immediately took advantage of the fact her name was mentioned, jumping to her feet excitedly as she announced, "Yosh! Leave it to me! I'll be everyone's big sister! Just leave it to me, Aniue~!" With Nobunaga having become something like an idol to her, at least as far as temperament and disposition were concerned, Mordred was more than willing to help look after her future children.</p><p>Shortly after Mordred's outburst, which had caused Nobunaga to produce a sly smile, Sakura also added, albeit in a more subdued tone, "I will also do my best...I always wanted to be a big sister..." While saying this, Sakura looked between her Okaa-chan and Otou-sama, her eyes communicating what her mouth couldn't say. They both understood the hidden meaning in that momentary gaze, causing Rin to flush slightly as she looked at Vahn as if asking for help. Unfortunately, his response was to smile in an affectionate manner, leaving the matter to Rin to decide. He was always happy to have more children but, knowing his part was only secondary to the role their mothers would play, Vahn always left the decision to his partners.</p><p>Understanding the meaning behind Vahn's smile, Rin's face paled slightly, even though her cheeks were flushed. Previously, she had already given up on having her own children as, after 'adopting' Sakura, she was worried that her treatment toward her biological children would alert the latter to the truth. Though she would do her best to always care for Sakura as if she was her actual daughter, Rin still had a lingering fear that her resolve might not translate well into reality. However, when she saw the expectant glimmer in Sakura's eyes, Rin looked towards Vahn with 'blame' in her eyes. This was her way of saying, 'take responsibility', causing Vahn to lightly chuckle at her expense before musing, "It looks like things are going to become lively in the future..."</p><p>---</p><p>After things settled down a bit, Vahn apologized to Tristana and Paracelsus for taking the wind out of their sails. To once again congratulate them, and to emphasize his apology, Vahn provided Tristana with a few [Maternity Band]s, which would greatly aid her during the pregnancy. She still seemed to be coming to terms with the fact she was pregnant but, with Paracelsus there to take care of her, it shouldn't be long before she accepted the reality and assumed the role of an expectant mother. As for Nobunaga, she shared a few words of 'triumph' with the girls around her before giving them a bit of 'advice' on what to expect if they sought children of their own.</p><p>Fortunately, before things could get too out of hand, Vahn guided the conversation back towards the original subject, explaining the Quest system that he intended to implement. When questioned about how such a system worked, Vahn explained that it was the result of his Familia Crest being able to bestow his 'blessing' upon others, combined with his Creation and Fate Laws. They were already aware of his Modify function and his ability to manifest physical objects the represented his bonds with other people so it wasn't too much of a surprise.</p><p>Though people like Da Vinci were obviously very skeptical, she knew there was undoubtedly some truth behind Vahn's words and, as was often the case, he probably just couldn't explain it properly. She knew his mind often made things overly complex, to the point that he was sometimes capable of doing things he didn't even comprehend properly. In fact, there had been several instances where she was the one to help him understand the proper uses of his skills and abilities. Because he was always very receptive to what she had to say, Da Vinci considered this rather severe flaw as one of Vahn's 'quirks', finding it more endearing than annoying.</p><p>With nobody calling him out on his half-truth, Vahn explained the benefits of the Quest system in great detail, including the fact there were likely benefits he was entirely unaware of. To that end, he wanted Da Vinci to keep track of every Quest and the rewards, compiling them into a system that used the Quest Board as a basis for data collection. Though he would always know when someone completed a Quest, as it alerted him through the system, Vahn knew Da Vinci would be able to make the most of the data. As for everyone else, Vahn encouraged them to freely accept Quests, so long as the Penalty did not include things like 'Death'.</p><p>After hearing about the potentially serious consequences of accepting Quests, it wasn't unexpected that Rin would ask, "Death? Do you mean failing a Quest could actually lead to death? Why would you incorporate such a thing?" Considering this was a question he had expected, Vahn answered in a serious tone, "The items that are created as a result of completing a difficult Quest could literally be world-altering. This system itself goes against the World's balance, altering Fate considerably based on the Rank of the Quest completed. It isn't even an exaggeration to say that some of the rewards you could obtain would even make the Greater Grail seem like a paltry trophy in comparison. Do you think such a system could exist without any setbacks...?"</p><p>Hearing Vahn's explanation, Rin couldn't help but furrow her brows, even though she understood the severity of his words. After all, the most basic principle in the world, outside of Life and Death, was Equivalent Exchange. She had also accepted a number of missions during her time as a student of the Clock Tower, some of which had put her life in danger, so Rin knew progress was often at the expense of endangering oneself. Still, while she could accept this, Rin looked toward Sakura before stating in a stern tone, "You are not allowed to accept Quests unless I am present, understood?"</p><p>Though Sakura was a bit started by the serious tone of her Okaa-chan's voice, she had no intention of going against her words as, even without having it explained to her, she knew death was a very scary thing. Fortunately, her own position was made easier when Artoria also added, "Mordred. Even though I believe you are more than strong enough, you are not allowed to accept any Quests to the outside world unless your father and I are aware of it. You are also not allowed to accept any Quests with Death as a Penalty before your apprenticeship is completed. Despite your skills, you have a long way to go before being able to declare yourself an Imperial Knight."</p><p>Even though she was brash by nature, Mordred had always been very obedient towards figures of authority, even in her past life. Though she had certainly led the rebellion against King Arthur, most of her interactions with Artoria before that were accepting and following all orders. As she had come to respect Artoria as her Hahaue, while accepting Vahn as her Chichue, Mordred would not ignore their words. Thus, showing a rare serious expression, similar to a Knight that had just received orders from its King, Mordred stated, "I understand, Hahaue. I will not be careless with my own life."</p><p>Nodding approvingly in response to Mordred's words, an action repeated by Vahn, Artoria turned her eyes over everyone else at the table, adding, "It may not have been officiated yet, but I hope you will all respect my decision as Empress. Unless it is at the behest of myself or His Majesty, never do anything that would endanger the life of yourself or others. There are no shortcuts to power and, even if this system will allow you to grow at an accelerated rate, you must never lose sight of why you seek power. If you feel inclined to accept dangerous Quests, please inform me or His Majesty beforehand. I am confident in speaking on his behalf when I say that we will always be willing to do our best to help you."</p><p>Piggybacking off Artoria's words, Vahn gave a firm nod before stating, "Though some Quests are more individualized, many can be completed by working together. Never ignore preparation and research as, if regarded seriously, most dangers can be avoided outright. As Artoria stated, I am more than willing to help you complete your Quests so never assume you are alone." With the Rank of the Quest seemingly determined by the person accepting it, Vahn felt that an S-Rank Quest for others might only be a B or A-Rank Quest for him. He obviously couldn't help when it came to things like befriending snakes, bathing, and meditating, but these were generally the types of Quests slated to specific individuals...</p><p>As nobody at the table really had the intention of seeking their deaths arbitrarily, the only thing that could have caused anyone to accept such a dangerous Quest was if the rewards more than made up for the danger. However, in response to Vahn's and Artoria's words, everyone around the table gave understanding nods, the only exception being Circe. She had already accepted a Quest with the penalty of death but, as it was very important for her 'life', she was more than willing to risk it. All she had to do was commune with Hecate and, as her relationship with the latter was actually quite good, Circe didn't expect she would refuse. Though there would be a trial that required her to prove her love, the fact she had a Love parameter of 33,998 filled her with confidence...</p><p>---</p><p>After the discussion regarding Quests, everyone enjoyed a rather lively meal before moving towards the Knight Training Field. While the discussion had been ongoing, Vahn transformed his Quest Board into a physical body before moving himself over and changing back. By the time the group arrived, there was a glossy black stone that was three meters tall and eight meters wide waiting for them. Da Vinci had almost immediately wanted to take a sample but Vahn was able to stop her by promising to explain its structure in greater detail later. He didn't really want everyone to know that the Quest Board was actually him, giving him full control over the Quests they were allowed to accept...</p><p>Though they could have all gone at once, everyone approached the Quest Board one at a time to see what their own Quests entailed. In response, the black stone dutifully translated their Quests into their native tongue, something that didn't even require effort on Vahn's part. As he would always use the language his partner was most comfortable with, to the point he still talked to Medusa in Koine, the text on the Quest Board did the same.</p><p>Being one of the first people to step forward, Da Vinci accepted a total of five Quests simultaneously, each graded at A-Rank. She was actually inspired just by reading the listed Quests, causing her mind to race with possibilities as, rather than completing the five she accepted, Da Vinci fully intended to complete ALL of her potential Quests. At the very least, she would prepare the necessary goods to finish them later so, by the time she turned in her current five, she would be able to mass accept and turn in several others. There was no way she could miss out on unique and mysterious rewards and, even though she only had a few Skills worth investing in, knowing she could freely enhance them was quite exciting.</p><p>Fortunately, Da Vinci's example wasn't repeated as Artoria was the next to step forward, placing her palm against the rather warm stone and viewing her available Quests. Surprisingly, she accepted an SS-Rank Quest that required her to defeat a total of 10 Heroic Spirits in serious combat. Though this was certainly possible to complete in the future, Artoria would be hard-pressed to convince people like Circe and Da Vinci to duel against her. This left only people like Scáthach, Heracles, Nobunaga, Lakshmibai, and Kenshin. Though she could also fight against people like Iris, Rin, and Illya, Vahn doubted that Artoria would trouble them in such a manner. Thus, until he summoned other Heroic Spirits in the future, Artoria would be stuck with her current Quest for a while.</p><p>Following Artoria's example, Mordred also accepted an SS-Rank Quest, hers being just as impossible to complete, at least for now. It required her to fight against an S-Rank Phantasmal Species, meaning something on the level of a True Dragon, Titan, or Pegasus. Since these types of creatures were very rare on the Surface World, she would have to venture into one of the Spiritual Lands or, depending on how things developed in the future, delve deep into the Spiritual Tomb: Albion. Still, with rewards like 500,000,000 Variable Experience and her very own Excalibur, named [Excalibur Λ], Mordred was more than up for the challenge.</p><p>With the Mother-Daughter duo of Knights accepting impossible tasks, Vahn breathed a sigh of relief when Rin picked a few relatively simple Quests. She also helped Sakura choose her Quests, with D-Rank being the highest. These included simple tasks such as performing exercises and completing chores, meaning they could incentivize themselves to grow stronger without any real danger. As a result, the highest amount of Variable Experience she could receive was only 1,500 but, considering Sakura was only seven years old, doing more difficult Quests could actually be detrimental to her natural growth.</p><p>As could be expected, even Paracelsus and Tristana accepted a few Quests as, if they were able to get rewarded for doing things they already would have done, why wouldn't they? Though Tristana picked a rather simple C-Rank Quest, as she was already starting to worry about her 'condition', Paracelsus accepted an A-Rank Quest. His Primary Objective was to create a thousand [Philosopher's Stone]s while his Optional Objective included making a new and improved variant. As the stones he made were already different from the 'original', Paracelsus already had some experience in this process and, with the information exchanges he had made with Da Vinci, Illya, and Iris, he was more than confident in finishing before the deadline...</p><p>When almost everyone had completed accepting Quests for themselves, making the atmosphere rather lively, Illya finally stepped up to the Quest Board. Curiously, in Vahn's vision, he noticed that the border of his current Quest became yellow while, at the very bottom of the list, a new Quest had formed. This was also displayed on the Quest Board, causing Vahn to inhale as he wondered what decision Illya would make. Previously, he had been on the fence regarding the completion of his own so, if Illya herself sought that route, Vahn could help her complete her objectives while also finishing his own Quest. This was the first time he had ever seen a Link Quest so he couldn't deny he was a little interested in the secondary rewards if they turned them in together...</p><p>As there were close to twenty available Quests, it took a little while before Illya's eyes passed over the 'unique' Quest that had come into existence just for her. When she saw the Objectives, her face became a little red and, though others had already read the details, she attempted to hide it with her body as she quickly accepted it. This caused a few of the closest people to giggle, including Iris as she had been standing next to Illya from the start. Still, willfully choosing to believe they were none the wiser, Illya stared at the screen that had appeared in her vision, her eyes becoming a subtle shade of violet...</p><p>-----------------------------------------------------------------</p><p>[Quest: Emergence of the Beast Queen]</p><p>Rank: SS</p><p>Objective(s): Convince entity [Cath Palug] to fuse with the host:(0/1), Integrate Magic Circuits with entity [Cath Palug]:(0/1)</p><p>Optional Objective(s): Obtain 100 Love with entity [Vahn Mason]:(99/100), Obtain an oath of love from entity [Vahn Mason]:(0/1)</p><p>Reward(s): 300,000,000 Variable Experience, 1x[Beast Queen's Divine Raiment]</p><p>Failure Conditions: Death, [Cath Palug]'s refusal</p><p>Penalty: Affection between host and [Cath Palug] reset to 0.
