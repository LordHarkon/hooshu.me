<p>After returning to the Hearth Manor, everyone began celebrating the marriage between Vahn and Riveria, causing a lively atmosphere to spread around. So that things were more 'scenic', they had decided to have a picnic in the clearing Vahn created in the illusory forest and it really was quite the beautiful sight. Though it wasn't as 'awe-inspiring' as the view of the continent from above, Vahn found the image of his 'family' together and celebrating to be truly inspiring. It was each of the people gathered together right now that spurred him onwards and gave him the strength to even face concepts like 'eternity' without fear. He may one day be forced to separate from them, but Vahn was absolutely confident they would be together again...</p><p>Seeing aside such matters, Vahn decided to just enjoy the moment so he sat next to Riveria in a loose circle with everyone else as they all passed around food and enjoyed each other's company. Riveria was quiet and reserved for the larger part of the meal but Vahn knew it was important to her to act in such a manner in front of everyone else. Her quiet and stoic look had been one of the things he had been drawn to in the past so, seeing her maintaining a similar disposition but with a small smile on her face, Vahn was very pleased. The fact that she leaned into him and often held his hand was also strangely fulfilling and he wondered what else would change now that they were married...</p><p>As the celebration wasn't intended to last for too long, Vahn and Riveria ended up splitting from the group around 2 PM and made their way silently through the forest. Generally, when a female High Elf had their first time, there was a large ceremony that took place to greatly increase the chance of pregnancy. There was an altar deep within the heart of the Sacred Tree and it would be sealed off for the wedded couple before they would both ingest a small portion of the Sacred Tree's Sap. Since the tree actually absorbed sunlight, the interior was lit up brightly and it was customary for their first time to be blessed by the light of the sun. As a High Elf Princess, Riveria wanted to at least emulate her traditions a little and Vahn knew it would be more 'comfortable' if they were in a place full of natural energy.</p><p>After a few minutes, they ended up at Terra's garden and saw the pristine emerald green wellspring situation at the center, radiating a massive amount of vital energy. Terra had allowed her garden to be used in exchange for having Vahn's bed to herself for the evening, even though she typically didn't like sleeping on beds. Vahn knew she was probably going to be enjoying his scent throughout the night, but that really didn't bother him much anymore. Once they were done here, Vahn would return to Riveria's room and stay there for the night and he was already looking forward to the peace and quiet they would experience together. Before that, however, things would take a decidedly different path and Riveria was already nearly crimson as he guided her forward.</p><p>Vahn extended his hand slightly and brought out a circular ornate bed that looked as though the base had been carved from wood. The bedding itself was a pristine white while the pillows were cream colored with an embroidered pattern of green leaves covering them. It wasn't an 'altar' at the center of a Sacred Tree, but it would undoubtedly be far more comfortable for both of them. Riveria took a deep breath through her nose and released a sigh when she saw the bed appear, saying, "I know what I'm supposed to do...but I'm lacking in experience, especially compared to you. I'll trust you, Vahn, so please don't make me do anything strange..." Most female High Elves actually lamented sex a great deal because it often marked the 'end' of their life and, even though she knew this wasn't the case for her, Riveria was still a little worried. After all, she had spent nearly fifty years 'delaying' the event before things reached this point...</p><p>Hearing her words, Vahn paused for a short while but continued to smile before stroking the side of her face with the back of his hand, moving the strands of loose hair over her inordinately long ears. In a gentle and calming tone, Vahn said, "Riveria, I will never make you do anything that would tarnish your dignity and pride. Since you trust me, I will show you that I'm worthy of such trust and treat you as gently as you deserve..." There were many girls Vahn could go to if he wanted to do something more 'intense' so he had no intention of 'forcing' Riveria into a difficult position just because they were now married. He was also very confident he could get a rise out of her just by treating her delicately, so Vahn didn't really feel the need to push her too hard.</p><p>Riveria nodded her head and, though she tried to stop it, released a sigh as she turned her eyes toward the wellspring. She had a mature and calm expression, even though her face had a mild blush, accompanied by a small smile and a resolute look in her eyes. With Vahn's 'promise', Riveria knew things wouldn't get too intense and this allowed her a bit of freedom to take actions she thought suitable. It was a little embarrassing to think about, but she wanted to be the one to be more proactive once their relationship advanced further. For now, however, she entrusted her body to Vahn and leaned into him slightly before looking up into his face. She was tall at 170cm, but Vahn stood slightly taller at 175cm, something that was hard to consider since she used to look down at him only recently...</p><p>Vahn reached his hand up to Riveria's chin and gave her a gentle peck on the lips, taking advantage of the fact she had already turned her head up at him. Riveria didn't make any effort to resist him at all so Vahn continued sealing her lips for nearly twenty seconds before moving away. She had a slightly dazed look before blinking and showing a small smile in response to affectionate action, causing Vahn's heart to throb as a result of how 'cute' she was. Even if she may be pushing herself a bit, Vahn found the changes in Riveria's behavior to be very refreshing and it made him want to try even harder to make her smile more.</p><p>Leading her to the bed, Vahn helped Riveria lay down before taking several deep breaths to calm himself after seeing her appearance. Though she hadn't changed much, seeing Riveria laying on her back with a blush on her face caused an eagerness to rise up in Vahn's chest as he pulled out the [Sage Aldrnari's Blessing]. Riveria had entrusted it to him previously and, after today, she would be wearing it for the next nine months. Her current gown covered her stomach, but they had already prepared a two-piece robe for her to wear after the fact. It was far more revealing than most Elven clothing, but this would likely become the norm for mature Elven women in the future since the [Sage Aldrnari's Blessing] would be a very important item to be worn by prospective mothers.</p><p>Riveria saw the green band in Vahn's hands and swallowed before a subtle magical light shone and her gown completely vanished. The only thing remaining on her body was pale-green underwear and the crown she had on her head, which Vahn felt suited her a great deal. Unfortunately, it would get in the way of her trying to wear the band since it was something they had to squeeze into by holding up their arms. Vahn thought about designing a version that could be strapped around the body, but such designs compromised the formation he had come up with and wouldn't 'guarantee' thing remained in place as well as a completely elastic band.</p><p>After helping Riveria squeeze into the band, an interesting experience all its own, Vahn looked at her with a very loving expression that made her feel a little panicky. This ended in one way, with her getting pregnant, and Riveria was feeling very nervous all of a sudden since there was a large influx of natural energy spreading through her lower abdomen. The red hue on her face was no longer just a result of her embarrassment and, even though they hadn't done anything yet, she started to take audible breaths that were slightly heated. In the past, she couldn't even wear the band for more than a few hours before 'having' to take it off and now Riveria knew she would be wearing it for around nine months straight...</p><p>Vahn reached out his hand and stroked around Riveria's belly, causing her to twitch and release a hot sigh that made him arch his brows slightly. Riveria frowned for a brief moment before her expression returned to normal after she once again reminded herself she was Vahn's wife. Vahn smiled after seeing her resolution and whispered, "The more natural energy your body absorbs, the higher the chance you'll get pregnant and the more pleasant everything will feel...remember, Riveria, the only people here are the two of us. Even if I don't push you to do embarrassing things, I'd like it if you show me your honest reactions..." As he spoke, Vahn inserted a small amount of his source energy directly into the [Sage Aldrnari's Blessing], allowing it to convert into a steady stream of natural energy that caused a wave of heat to flow through Riveria's body.</p><p>Riveria had been about to answer Vahn's words but instead released a very hot and heavy sigh, causing an even deeper blush to appear on her face. Vahn guided her body back so that she was laying down on the bed once again and whispered, "You will only ever have to show this kind of reaction to me, Riveria...and it would make me feel very happy if you opened yourself up to me, at least when we're together like this. I promise I'll do my best to make you happy as well..." This time, Vahn closed his eyes after his words fell and a magical light shone over his skin. His tanned skin became a fair white while his dark brown hair turned into a jade-green, much like Riveria's. His toned and fit body became somewhat slender but the most notable change was the fact that his ears, which had been curved like a human's, were now long and angular, exactly like a High Elf's.</p><p>Seeing Vahn's transformation, Riveria held her breath completely and felt her mind go blank for a moment even though she knew he was going to turn into a High Elf already. He was already very handsome when he was a human, almost 'strangely' so, but Vahn's High Elf form made her heart beat madly in her chest because he was inarguably the most handsome 'man' she had ever seen. Most races, though they could appreciate the beauty of other species, typically had a preference for their own and it was a big 'impact' on some girls to see Vahn transform into their same race. For Riveria, it was even more effective because of the 'significance' Vahn's transformation represented to her, their future children, and the entire Elven race...</p><p>Vahn ran his fingers through his own hair, marveling at his silky it had become since he used Riveria's energy flow as a template. He could sense the change in her aura, including the passionate red tendrils that 'flicked' against his skin bashfully, and it made him happy that she was so happy. For Vahn, his 'true' form had been a sickly boy without arms and legs so he didn't really feel any aversion to the other forms he took, regardless of race. They were all 'him', and that was the only thing that mattered besides the girls being happy. Just as they changed for him, by working out or making personal sacrifices, Vahn didn't mind becoming the man of their dreams, especially since that man was still him. He also liked to experience how they felt the world since his senses would change to match their's in the process, so this was a win-win for both parties as he sat next to Riveria and stroked her belly with a smile.</p><p>Riveria felt another flood of energy pass through her body and she knew Vahn was definitely 'accelerating' the absorption process. She needed to absorb enough energy to start the ovulation process and knew Vahn was also trying to 'warm' her up so she wouldn't be hurt when they started having sex. However, though she could 'rationalize' what was happening, Riveria quickly felt like she was losing herself and gripped the sheets tightly as her nails dug into the plush mattress. Even though Vahn wasn't doing much to stimulate her directly, the natural energy in her body was very intense and Riveria felt a mixture of shame, panic, and an indescribable pleasure, unlike anything she had ever experienced.</p><p>Vahn marveled at how Riveria had been able to keep her composure at first but, perhaps because she wanted to show him an 'honest' reaction, she eventually gripped the sheets and pushed her feet against the bed after around two minutes. This caused Vahn's eyes to open slightly as Riveria looked toward the blue sky overhead with a 'pained' expression and a great deal of confusion. Vahn was very surprised by her 'innocent' reaction because she was typically a very mature and stoic woman but, after recalling how Ryuu and Eina reacted, he felt like this was actually an Elven racial trait. She wasn't actually a lewd woman, but Riveria seemed to be very sensitive and Vahn wondered if, like Ryuu and Eina, her breasts were also one of her 'sweet' spots...</p><p>Without any hesitation, Vahn ran his right hand along Riveria's side before moving it to her back when she arched slightly. In a single swift motion, Vahn unfastened the clasp of her bra and saw the pushed up pair of breasts relax and lose their volume. He smiled while Riveria herself showed a complicated look on her face and averted her eyes away in shame. She wore padded push-up bras to make her breasts look larger since the [Elven Queen's Gown] showed off more cleavage than she was used to. Now, the 'illusion' had been broken and, even though Vahn didn't seem to mind it at all, Riveria was still a little embarrassed about the size of her breasts.</p><p>Vahn stored the bra into his Inventory while Riveria was distracted and saw her pale white breasts and the cherry-red buds that stood atop what Vahn felt like were 'perfectly' sized mounds. She actually wasn't as small as her reaction would dictate and was a healthy B-Cup, even if it was on the lower end of the spectrum. In Vahn's opinion, they were the perfect size for holding and, given the softness he knew Riveria's body possessed, he was actually very interested in her breasts. His experience with Eina and Ryuu gave him a bit of expectation so, while she was still a bit distracted, Vahn leaned over her chest and unceremoniously began nibbling on her nipple.</p><p>Riveria felt like a jolt of electricity ran through her body and she pulled away from Vahn instinctually, nearly falling off of the bed before Vahn used [Shundo] to appear behind her, catching her in the process. Riveria was breathing very quickly and had a startled expression on her face, almost trying to escape Vahn's hands once again before she realized what she was doing. Suddenly, she felt ashamed of her actions once again and became ruby red as she lowered her head and said, "Sorry...that was...unexpected..." Vahn maintained a calm smile on his face but his stomach felt especially giddy right now and he felt like Riveria's reactions were going to awaken something inside of him. She was simply too adorable and this was how she was acting before they even moved on to the main event...</p><p>Since he was already behind her, Vahn reached around and hugged Riveria's body firmly in his embrace, whispering, "I said I wanted to see your honest reactions...so don't apologize. You can tell, right? I'm very happy right now..." Riveria had seen Vahn's previous expression, which was why she hung her head in shame, so she knew he was actually somewhat 'excited' even though she herself felt embarrassed. Before she could overthink it, however, Riveria released a soft, yet high pitched, moan when Vahn suddenly began nibbling on her ear. He also used his 'hot' tongue to race along the back and Riveria felt like her face was burning up greatly while he continued to hold her firmly, almost as if he was preventing her escape.</p><p>Vahn could sense the tensions in Rivera's body increasing along with her trembling as he continued to place his left hand over the scale around her abdomen and infuse even more energy into it. Around the same time she released another sigh, Vahn whispered, "Riveria, I love you...", causing her body to tremble even more. Before she could respond, Vahn brought his right hand to her left breast and gently cupped it in his hand as he said, "Your breasts are honestly the perfect size already...but they'll become even bigger during your pregnancy...have more confidence in yourself, as our child will look to both of us when developing their own confidence..." Vahn continued to nibble around Riveria's ears, something that was especially sensual an intimate for all Elves.</p><p>Hearing his words, Riveria released another sigh, something she seemed very prone to do, but felt a lot better all of a sudden. It wasn't just that he said her breasts were already 'perfect', but the fact he reminded her of the changes her body would experience during pregnancy. She had seen both of Aina's pregnancies and, even after her children were weaned, her breasts had stayed marginally larger than when they were at the Elven Kingdom. This made Riveria even more hopeful for the future, even though it was a bit of a silly concern when compared against all the other things related to her pregnancy.</p><p>Vahn moved down to Riveria's neck, smelling her somewhat grassy yet sweet smelling hair along the way, and began kissing her shoulder while lightly pinching her nipple with his fingers. Riveria's body trembled greatly once again and Vahn could sense the nerves exploding like fireworks every time he stimulated her, even without using his [Hands of Nirvana]. This was the third instance where he had seen a woman of Elven heritage show special sensitivity through their breasts so he was almost certain it had to be a racial trait. Vahn thought that this was perhaps the reason many of them were self-conscious about their bust sizes, not that it truly mattered.</p><p>Riveria had already experienced three light climaxes under Vahn's 'care' but he knew things would need to escalate further if he wanted to prepare her properly. His eyes had been glowing a magical blue color for a while now and he could see that her body was rapidly processing the natural energy and filtering out the rest. This was an important discovery since it seemed like insemination was necessary to actually 'jumpstart' the process and force ovulation, meaning the formation and band would be supporting the process and not 'triggering' it. Long term effects could always be studied later but Vahn was at least able to discern that her body wouldn't ovulate just by 'external' stimulation...</p><p>Moving his head back up to the side of her face, Vahn also raised his hand to stroke Riveria's chin as he calmly said, "This next part will be a little intense, Riveria...prepare yourself..." Almost immediately after he spoke, Rivera's body trembled again and Vahn could feel small reverberations pass through her body as she experienced a fourth small orgasm. Because she was an intelligent woman, Riveria had a somewhat overactive imagination at times and it seemed like the 'anticipation' had caused her body to react a little. Vahn smiled while Riveria closed her eyes in preparation and embarrassment as Vahn moved his hand slowly down Riveria's abdomen.</p><p>Tracing his fingers along the band of her pale green panties, Vahn could feel the lukewarm heat coming from Riveria's body as she trembled greatly under the light contact. Instead of storing away her panties into his Inventory, Vahn decided to leave them in place for the time being and slowly probed into the silky fabric while letting his palm come to rest against her lower abdomen, just above her groin. Compared to her own body heat, Riveria noticed that Vahn's was much hotter and it was almost like the heat from his palm was spreading through her body the moment he touched her. She was very sensitive to energy and knew he wasn't doing anything 'strange' but it didn't really help her deal with the situation any, especially when he slowly traced his fingers towards a 'dangerous' area...</p><p>Vahn knew he was 'teasing' her a bit at the moment so, without taking things too far he traced his fingers over the very smooth crease of Riveria's vagina and noticed she was already quite wet. However, this wasn't enough and Vahn had already told her to 'prepare' herself so, after gently probing the interior with his fingers, Vahn trailed them up to the top of her vagina until he found a slightly hard but 'pliable' protrusion that had been trying its best to remain hidden. In a low and calming voice, Vahn whispered, "Take a deep breath..." and waited for Riveria's trembling to steady while she followed his words. The moment she did so, Vahn inserted the most minuscule thread of energy directly into Riveria's clitoris while holding her body in a firm embrace as she released a very nasally moan before eventually overcoming the limits of her ability to contain it and crying out in a sensual and surprisingly high pitched voice...</p><p>(A/N: Alternate Titles: 'Terra Invades Vahn's Bed','Hope for the Future','Riveria is rather sensitive (UwU)~!')</p><p>https://www.*******.com/user?u=14397149</p><p>paypal.me/Einlion</p><p>Discord Invite: https://discord.gg/Jwa8PKh</p></main><div class="link-group"><a class="btn" href="00611.html">Previous</a><a class="btn" href="../index.html">Table of Contents</a><a class="btn" href="00613.html">Next</a></div></div><div class="right-icon theme"><input type="image" id="themeButton" src="https://i.imgur.com/PWAzExk.png" height="25"></div><div id="readpos">0%</div><script src="../js/theme.js"></script></body></html>
