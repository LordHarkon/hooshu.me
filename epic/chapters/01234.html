<p>With the arrival of a new dawn, Vahn found himself seated upon his Throne with his eyes closed and his back straight. Around him, standing at the various level he had established for each different Soul Tier, the vast majority of the castle's residents stood in attendance. It looked a little awkward, as they were spread out quite a bit, but it also put things in perspective and served as a powerful motivator to some.</p><p>Today was a historic day for the Empire as, any minute now, he would be holding Court for the first time. This would also be his first official audience within the Nasuverse and Vahn was curious as to how the representatives of the Fae would act. He, fortunately, had the aid of Vivian in reaching out to each group so, with the exception of the Sylphs, the others had agreed readily to an audience. As for the latter group, Merlin managed to get them to attend by essentially calling them cowards who were afraid to face the Sage Emperor.</p><p>Vahn was expecting a bit of trouble from the representative of the Sylphs but, as this was already a foregone conclusion, he didn't particularly mind Merlin's scheme. It wasn't as if he intended to make the Fae bow to his will. His primary goal was to try and establish cooperation between the Empire and the Fae. Other than that, he would inform them of the laws they needed to follow as citizens of Avalon, lest they are driven out and exiled to their former homes.</p><p>After thinking about the various ways in which things could develop, Vahn opened his eyes to take in a view of his surroundings one last time before they began. He had Artoria, Kenshin, and Lakshmibai standing on the level closest to him, causing Vahn to feel comforted by their smiles. Though it was a little strange to have his Empress and Queen-Empress Consorts standing, it would ruin the symbolic nature of the Throne Room if he had more than one Throne at this point. This would change in the future but, at least for the time being, it represented a burden that only he could bear.</p><p>As Vahn looked around the area, his eyes briefly settled on Mordred and Sakura, causing his smile to widen marginally as he saw the fighting spirit in the former's eyes. She currently only had a Tier 3 soul so she had a long way to go before being able to reach the Throne, despite being the Imperial Princess. When she saw him smiling at her, however, Mordred returned one of her own and, if not for the fact she would get a very long lecture for it, she might have even shouted out to make her ambitions known.</p><p>Vahn gave an approving nod in response to her resolve, causing Mordred to proudly puff out her non-existent chest, now more evident than ever due to the fact she was wearing a dress. Since she could only attend his Court as the Imperial Princess, she had to dress the part. Because of this, Vahn got to see Mordred wearing a ruby-red princess gown, complete with an ornate tiara. Her wild hair had also been tamed for the event, giving her an appearance almost indiscernible to her mother's, albeit a little younger. As for Sakura, she was wearing a sapphire-blue dress, as if to contrast the one her older sister was wearing. Instead of one neat bun at the back of her head, she had two tidy buns atop her head in the odango-style, making her look even more adorable than normal.</p><p>Seeing that he was looking directly at her, Sakura actually gave a small curtsy, causing Vahn to repress a chuckle as he internally remarked how mature she was. Though this also troubled him a bit, as she had recently started trying to spend more time with Galahad than Mordred, Vahn didn't think there was any cause for concern.</p><p>Sakura was a sensible girl so, while she might be experiencing puppy love, Vahn didn't expect she would seriously pursue the man who was more than twenty years her senior. At the very least, he didn't have to worry for another six or seven years and, with Galahad's nature, that number was probably closer to ten or twenty. With that thought in mind, Vahn gave a brief glance toward the pale-haired Knight, earning a small bow from him in turn.</p><p>After returning a small nod of his own, Vahn took a deep breath as, toward the entrance to the Throne Room, several figures had started to congregate. Once they had all been arranged, the large double-doors were opened, revealing several Homunculi wearing white and gold armor, adorned with feathers and the relief of a dragon, phoenix, tiger, and turtle. This was the design Da Vinci had come up with for his Knights, albeit with a few different variations depending on rank.</p><p>With the group of Homunculi forming two neat columns along the stairs descending toward the Throne, Gawain announced in a loud tone that echoed within the chamber, "The representative of the Dwarves, Gwent Silvervein, and company, has arrived at the behest of his Imperial Majesty, the Sage Emperor, Vahn Aldrnari Mason."</p><p>After Gawain's announcement, a short and stout man with a dark-grey beard nearly reaching the floor waddled into the Throne Room. His beard was adorned with several braids and accessories while, at his sides, four other Dwarves, each accompanied by a Vulcanae, a Lesser Flame Elemental. Vahn had learned that this particular tribe of Dwarves had made a pact with the Vulcanae around the same time that most of the Fae retreated to the Reverse Side of the World. This meant, for the last two-thousand years, they had lived alongside each other, maintaining a mutualistic relationship between their respective races.</p><p>From the perspective of the Dwarves and Vulcanae, who were just now meeting Vahn for the first time, the former felt a mountainous pressure while the latter, attuned to nature, actually saw him in a very positive light. All Elementals were drawn to concentrated energy sources so, with Vahn's body being comprised of Source Energy, he was like an oasis in the middle of the desert to them. If not for their pacts with the Dwarves, they might have even danced happily around him, bathing in the aura that intimidated others.</p><p>Once the party had arrived before him, Vahn was somewhat surprised when Gwent bowed low, as the Dwarves were known for their somewhat arrogant and haughty natures. He couldn't help but wonder what Vivian had said to them but, as this wasn't the time to ponder over such things, he simply smiled in response to the respectful display while stating in a deep and resonant tone, "It pleases us to see you and your company in good health, Lord Silvervein. Tell us, have you had any issues adapting to Avalon's climate?"</p><p>Shaking his head while keeping his eyes lowered, Gwent answered in an even deeper tone than Vahn, sounding much like the rumbling of the earth as he stated, "It's been a blessing to call Avalon our home for the last month. We have no complaints, only admiration for His Majesty." As these words left his mouth, Gwent felt an even greater amount of pressure, even though Vahn wasn't doing anything to suppress him.</p><p>Seeing the sweat glistening on the man's brow, Vahn squinted his eyes slightly, wondering why they seemed so nervous. What he didn't account for was the fact that, as Spirits attuned to Nature, they were extremely sensitive to the presence of Alaya and ORT, even though the two were kept their presences masked. From their perspective, though Vahn himself seemed rather harmless, there was an aura around him that seemed to promise, not just death, but complete annihilation.</p><p>In the face of an existence that could squash them in an instant, despite any attempts to resist, they could only swallow their pride and lower their heads. The only reason the Vulcanae were unaffected by the two Tier 5 entities was due to the fact they were far more sensitive to intentions and, with Vahn showing no hostility, only positive vibes, they felt extremely calm.</p><p>To alleviate the strange tension in the air, Vahn gave a small nod before saying, "Please, rise, all of you." Then, after waiting for them to stand, Vahn gestured to his surroundings, asking, "What do you think of our creation? With the unrivaled prestige of the Dwarves when it comes to forging, crafting, and construction, we are curious to know how you evaluate our Throne Room." Though he intended to befriend the Dwarves through competition and trade in the future, Vahn wanted to see how they would react after knowing he had constructed the Throne Room on his own.</p><p>Hearing Vahn's question, Gwent and his fellow Dwarves began to look around the area, their eyes glimmering with runes that were imperceptible to most. After this process came to an end, Gwent began to stroke his beard habitually as he answered, "The place was constructed masterfully. There are some parts that even I can't see through. Though our best could easily make something better, the Artisan you tasked with constructing this Throne Room deserves praise."</p><p>Realizing that Gwent hadn't understood the implication in his words, Vahn gave a light chuckle that caused the group of Dwarves to begin sweating nervously. He then adopted an amused smile as he said, "Thank you for your kind words, Lord Silvervein. Though it may come as a surprise to you, this chamber had been constructed by myself and no others."</p><p>With Vahn literally spelling it out for him, Gwent understood what he was trying to say, causing his face to pale slightly as he added, "Your Majesty is truly gifted in the arts. Even some of our Masters may not be able to contend against you..." This remark caused Vahn to laugh once again, resulting in Gwent allowing his words to trail off as he swallowed a lump in his throat. Though it seemed like the Emperor before him was acting very casually, he felt like there were thousands of spears at his back as he was forced to walk ever-closer to the edge of a cliff.</p><p>Understanding that his actions were only unnerving the group unnecessarily, Vahn stopped trying to ease the tensions, stating in a calm tone of voice, "Our purpose in requesting your presence here is to establish friendly relations with the Dwarves and Vulcanae. If you intend the permanently settle within Avalon, you will be considered citizens of the Aldrnari Empire. To that effect, there are certain laws that all citizens must follow to ensure the safety and security of all peoples and species who come to reside here. Avalon is intended to be a Sanctuary for the Fae and all persecuted species so there must be order to avoid conflict."</p><p>Now that Vahn was acting more like an Emperor, Gwent, and co, were able to breathe a sigh of relief as the former answered, "Queen Effe had entrusted us the task of ascertaining whether or not Avalon can be the home Merlin had promised. So long as our pride is respected, we are willing to adhere to the laws of the land. However, though we agree to become citizens of the Empire, know that we will not become the tools to forge weapons and armaments for the purpose of war and conquest."</p><p>Since Vahn was aware of the terms of the pact between the Dwarves and Vulcanae, he already knew it would be difficult to convince them to produce weapons. As the weapons they produced were an extension of themselves, there had been an incalculable number of Dwarves corrupted by mankind using their creations to wage endless conflict. To preserve their already diminishing numbers, they had made a pact with the Vulcanae, becoming builders and protectors, not destroyers.</p><p>Without any hesitation, Vahn gave a solemn nod in response to Gwent's words before stating, "The purpose of the Empire is to protect its citizens, not the other way around. Though we may ask your people to assist in the construction of houses and fortifications, know that, as citizens of the Empire, it is far more important to us that you are able to live free and happy lives. Do what you believe is best for your people, so long as it does not endanger the security and livelihoods of other citizens."</p><p>After Vahn finished speaking, he looked toward Gareth waiting on the second level, causing her to perk up as she quickly descended the steps and handed a scroll to Gwent. She then gave a very low bow towards Vahn before running back up the stairs to resume her place.</p><p>Adding on to his previous statement, Vahn looked toward Gwent, explaining, "It is not our intention to force you to pledge your allegiance here and now. That scroll dictates all of the laws your people will be expected to follow. You will be given a month's time to review the terms before we personally visit to hear your response. Know that, regardless of your final decision, the Empire will always be the ally of the Fae. Though you will be asked to leave the Island, we will guarantee your safety until you reach the domain of the Fairy Queen."</p><p>Understanding that his time was coming to an end, Gwent held the scroll in his hands as if it was an important treasure as he bowed respectfully toward Vahn. This action was mirrored by his fellow Dwarves while, at their sides, the Vulcanae giggled mischievously. Unlike the serious Dwarves, they were more playful and unrestrained by nature. Even when Vahn dismissed the group so he could meet with the next representative, they waved innocently with childish smiles on their faces. As he was not the type to be overly serious, except when he needed to be, Vahn returned their wave with a lighthearted smile on his face, earning another round of giggles from the Lesser Elementals as they accompanied their partners out of the Throne Room.</p><p>After the departure of Gwent's entourage, Gawain wasted no time in announcing the entrance of the next group or, more specifically, person, "The representative of the Undine, Aerwyna, has arrived at the behest of the Sage Emperor, Vahn Aldrnari Mason!"</p><p>Following Gawain's bellow, a humanoid with pale-blue skin, black sclera, green eyes, and distinctly fish-like traits began descending the stairs. She was attired in a strange blue dress that seemed to be comprised of something akin to silk, albeit with a peculiar seaweed-like quality. What stood out the most was, rather than hair, her head had extensions that almost looked like tentacles, albeit arranged in a strangely stylish fashion. This, combined with her golden accessories and streamlined body, gave her an elegant, albeit alien, appearance.</p><p>Upon reaching the bottom of the steps, Aerwyna lifted the edges of her dress, performing a flawless curtsy, stating in a soft voice that caught Vahn by surprise, "It is an honor to stand in the presence of the Sage Emperor."</p><p>Rather than allow his surprise to show, as this would be extremely rude, Vahn gave an approving nod before saying, "Please, raise your head, Lady Aerwyna." This caused the Undine woman to look up at him with her green eyes, just in time for Vahn to see her blink with a second set of eyelids. He found this rather fascinating, causing a small smile to adorn his face as he began a similar dialogue to his previous conversation, asking how the Undine were adapting to the island's environment.</p><p>According to Aerwyna, the waters around Avalon were like a haven to her people as, even within the depths of the ocean, they were not outside the influence of humanity's wasteful habits. Here, there was no pollution to speak of as, for the last fifteen hundred years, Avalon had been isolated from the rest of the world in its own sub-texture. Since the concentration of mana was even higher than many leylines, they were able to breathe easily and, much to Vahn's surprise, had even started producing offspring to expand their population.</p><p>Undine had an arguably easier time rearing children than many races as, rather than carrying their children, they produced batches of eggs when the conditions were suitable. It was possible for a single Undine female to produce upwards of thirty eggs at a time, though this was only under ideal conditions. In the near future, their numbers would expand exponentially but, fortunately, this was not without a limit. As their numbers increased, the conditions for producing further offspring would be compromised, making it difficult for them to sustain large populations without adverse effects on the existing population.</p><p>Needless to say, Aerwyna and her people were more than willing to become citizens of the Empire, so long as he guaranteed they would not be poached and hunted. As this was a given, Vahn had Gareth hand over a scroll before promising to visit the Undine settlement within the next month. This apparently coincided with the time their offspring would start hatching, resulting in Aerwyna directly extending an invitation to have him attend the event. Since this would be a good way to foster positive relations between the Empire and the Undine in the future, Vahn graciously accepted before sending Aerwyna on her way.</p><p>Vahn couldn't help but imagine what it would be like to watch hundreds of tiny Undines hatching from their nursery. They were actually somewhat cute as a species so, imagining a batch of miniature Undine brought a smile to his face. He was even tempted to discuss the viability of making aquatic-type Companions, something Da Vinci should readily agree to. Since she wanted them to have the ability to evolve into virtually any kind of creature, it would be necessary to acquire data for all types of environments, not just terrestrial.</p><p>While Vahn was thinking about tiny, harpy-like Companions, Gawain announced the next group of representatives, breaking him from his momentary reverie. At the same time, Vahn's expression softened slightly as, accompanying Gawain's introduction, a group of eight child-like humanoids with brown skin, green hair, green eyes, and leaf-like clothing entered the Throne Room. Though he knew some of them were hundreds of years old, Vahn couldn't help but have a soft spot for these adorable Fae and their innocent appearances.</p><p>Leading the group was a Dryad named Rosemanis, possessing leaf-green hair that was styled into a neat bob. She had a small crown formed from braided twigs and, at a glance, appeared no older than ten years of age. Despite this, Vahn felt her aura was particularly ancient and, though it was hard to be certain, he guessed she was well over a thousand years old. She also carried herself with dignity but, upon reaching the well where they were directed to stand, the entire group dropped to their knees in a seiza-like position before bowing their heads low to the ground.</p><p>Vahn felt a little awkward to have them bow in such a subservient manner but, once again retaining a mask of calm, he gave them leave to raise their heads. With this, he had eight little girls kneeling before him, their leafy dresses splayed out neatly as they looked at him with large, almond-shaped eyes. Their representative started off by expressing her gratitude in much the same was as Aerwyna, stating just how much of a blessing it had been for their kind to be allowed to live in Avalon.</p><p>Due to the rampant deforestation of various regions, especially around leylines, the Dryads were one of the Fae species that had been hit the hardest by humanity's errant ways. Though they had a stable population within the Land of Twilight, under the protection of the Fairy Queen, Celia, it was almost impossible for them to live elsewhere. Having a second place to call home, filled with an abundance of mana and an ample amount of food was a blessing they had never expected to receive. Because of this, Rosemanis, one of the few Dryad Princesses, actually requested permission to bring more of her sisters, promising to bring an endless Spring to Avalon in the near future.</p><p>Since he had no reason to disagree, Vahn gave his permission, so long as the Dryads were willing to follow the laws of the Empire. He promised them protection but, in exchange, they would not be able to arbitrarily steal the life force of the humans who would one day come to reside on the island. Though this might be necessary for their reproduction, he promised they would not have to worry about such things as, in the not-so-distant future, he intended to plant a World Tree at the heart of the island. This was something he had already discussed with Artoria, Merlin, and Da Vinci so, once things had stabilized, he intended to fork over the 500,000,000OP necessary to purchase a [Seed of the World Tree].</p><p>Though he was limited to items that existed within the Record he inhabited, Vahn was able to buy Unique items after the system shop had been upgraded. Since Yggdrasil and the World Tree were concepts that existed within the Nasuverse, he had the option of purchasing a version of the seed he had obtained in Danmachi. He was looking forward to having another adorable surrogate daughter and, if she had the same power as her older sister, Vahn knew Avalon would gain an unbelievably powerful protector.</p><p>Hearing Vahn's promise, the Dryads were obviously shaken and, before accepting the scroll and departing the Throne Room, they gave another low bow, expressing their sincere gratitude for the chance to flourish once again. Vahn felt just as awkward the second time they bowed to him but, as it was their choice to do so, he accepted their gratitude graciously before sending them on their way, promising to visit in the near future...</p><p>(A/N: Alternate Titles: 'Galahad better watch his back','Vahn be spookin','Turns out Vahn is quite popular with the Fae','The resurgence of Yggy-chan!?')</p><p>(A/N: Quick Clarification. Though Artoria had a Tier 3 Soul as well, this changed when she re-attuned with the Holy Spear and obtained Avalon once again.)</p><p>https://bit.ly/2XBzAYu &lt;-(p.atreon link)</p><p>paypal.me/Einlion</p><p>Discord Invite: https://discord.gg/mn5xMbE</p></main><div class="link-group"><a class="btn" href="01233.html">Previous</a><a class="btn" href="index.html">Table of Contents</a><a class="btn" href="01235.html">Next</a></div></div><div id="readpos">0%</div></body></html>
