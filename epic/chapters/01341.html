<p>Feeling the changes in her body, Arcueid was more than surprised, she was at an absolute loss. She could feel her Vampiric Impulse fade away in its entirety and, for reasons she couldn't completely understand, Vahn's aura suddenly felt infinitely more comfortable than before. Part of her wished he would hug her tight enough that their bodies would fuse together, a thought that made her heart flutter quite a bit...</p><p>Vahn was, of course, aware of the change in the way Arcueid viewed him but, knowing it would be better to let her make decisions about their future, he pretended not to notice. It would be too easy for him to take advantage of her immediately after her transformation as, much like other Spirits, she was instinctually drawn to his Source Energy constitution. It was like how a flower would blossom in the presence of the sun, eagerly soaking up the life-giving rays of light to nourish itself.</p><p>Still, this didn't mean Vahn was going to simply do 'nothing' as, prior to expelling Crimson Moon, he had made a few promises. With this in mind, he broke Arcueid from her momentary stupor, tracing his thumb along her bottom lip to see how she would react. This reminded her of the embarrassing incident from before but, rather than shy away, she looked up at him, her sapphire eyes glimmering slightly before slowly closing them.</p><p>Never one to shy away from an open invitation, Vahn lowered his head to meet Arcueid's lips but, just as he was about to make contact, Vahn dispelled the [Space-Time Orb], ejecting their spiritual bodies. If he was going to kiss her, he would rather do so in reality as it would have a far greater impact.</p><p>Arcueid obviously noticed the change in setting but she didn't seem to mind it as Vahn completed his prior action in the real world. He began to guide her in a progressively more intimate kiss while cradling her body in his comforting embrace. This was in spite of the fact that the Millenium Castle around them had faded away in its entirety, leaving them standing in the middle of the air, a pristine blue sky filled with clouds surrounding them...</p><p>After losing the power of Crimson Moon, Arcueid was no longer able to manifest the Millenium Castle. Despite this, she still had her Marble Phantasm so, if she so desired, creating a completely new castle was well-within her ability to do so. For now, however, she was more focused on the moment she shared with Vahn. It felt like the void within her heart was being rapidly filled by his presence, something Arcueid had thought impossible due to the nature of her existence.</p><p>Unfortunately, as all good things were want to do, the moment came to an end sooner than she would have liked. Were it up to her, she would freeze this singular moment in time and savor it for all eternity. As for Vahn, he had other matters to attend so, while he was growing increasingly fond of Arcueid, he couldn't tend to her indefinitely. More than ten days had passed within Avalon while he was meeting with her so there were a lot of things requiring his attention.</p><p>Since he could tell she was saddened by the reality they couldn't stay together indefinitely, Vahn rested his forehead against Arcueid's, whispering in a guiding tone, "I promised to make you happy. While I have confidence in being able to do so using my own power, people are happiest when they have a lot of people to interact with. I don't want you to feel like everything needs to be rushed so, for now, we'll return to Avalon and introduce you to everyone else. You have been sealed away and isolated from the world for too long. It would make me happy to see you surrounded by friends and family..."</p><p>Hearing Vahn's words, Arcueid lazily nodded her head in response but, rather than allow him to part from her, she put a little bit of strength into her embrace as she said, "I honestly don't know what it means to be truly happy...I will trust your judgment. If you believe I will be happier by befriending others, I will do my best to get along. Still, no matter what happens, you have to take responsibility for your actions...I won't let you get away with making me someone else's problem..."</p><p>Vahn was a little taken aback by Arcueid's words as it seemed like she had been able to see through his intentions completely. In truth, he wanted to give her a bit of time to adapt to life and, if possible, help her find someone worthy of her love. He truly wanted her to be happy so, if she was able to find someone that could love her completely, Vahn felt she would be much happier than being a member of his ever-expanding harem.</p><p>Since Arcueid was basically asking him to make her his, Vahn wasn't going to shirk his responsibility in the matter. She was an exceptionally beautiful woman and, while she was a little naive, she was more than qualified to make her own decisions. If this was what she wanted, even if it was only as a result of his coaxing, he wasn't going to disappoint her.</p><p>With this in mind, Vahn put more strength into his own embrace before giving Arcueid a taste of what she had gotten herself into. He snaked his right hand down her lower back, causing a red hue to color her cheeks as he went even further to her surprisingly toned butt. She was wearing the same white dress as before, albeit with a few slight changes, but he was able to feel her body heat through the fabric without any difficulty. Then, remembering her earlier words, he leaned in close to her ear and whispered, "I can be pretty greedy..."</p><p>Following his words, Vahn could feel a tremble pass through Arcueid's body but, moments later, she repeated her own words back to him, causing a smile to spread across his face as she muttered, "It's okay to be greedy...", her hot breath tickling his ear...</p><p>Though he had been holding himself back out of consideration for Illya, Vahn knew this wasn't really a moment where he could afford to take a step back. Arcueid had just experienced a series of world-changing events so, while she would be fine without one, having something to ground herself would allow her to face the future with greater resolution. He understood that her insistence was partly due to her fear of an uncertain future so, while apologizing to Illya and several others in his mind, Vahn pressed his lips to Arcueid's, pushing her down in mid-air as he began peeling away her clothing...</p><p>Using her reality manipulation, Arcueid created a strange crystalline room around them, complete with a massive bed formed of rainbow-hued crystal. The light from the faux-sun outside refracted throughout the structure she had made, creating an indescribably beautiful and stunning scenery with an atmosphere to match. Since he doubted she had the wherewithal to think about what she had created, Vahn liked to think that this was her natural response to what was happening, egging him ever-onward as Arcueid tightly clung to his body.</p><p>It was obvious that Arcueid lacked any real experience but, with literally hundreds of years at his back, Vahn was able to guide her through the necessary steps. He started off by getting her to relax as, with her literally digging her nails into his back, it was difficult to remove her clothing. Then, as she lay against silky-smooth sheets, glimmering with gentle blue hues, he deftly removed her gown to reveal quite the awe-inspiring sight.</p><p>Though it wasn't particularly surprising, Arcueid was wearing a pure-white lace bodice beneath her gown, completed by intricate silk panties and similarly white stockings with a garter belt. It was truly a sight to behold and, for a brief moment, Vahn watched in stunned silence as Arcueid's blush slowly spread across her entire body. This was a scene he could never grow tired of and, though it was a bit cliche, he couldn't help but gently stroked her abdomen as he said, "Truly, a beauty no description would do justice..."</p><p>At this point, Arcueid was trembling like a newborn lamb. When she heard Vahn's words, her instinct was to close her legs, a futile endeavor considering he had already positioned himself in between her plump thighs. Then, failing this, she began to writhe about under Vahn's palm in a vain attempt to escape the spreading heat and electrical sensation flowing into her abdomen. It seemed to ignore her regenerative abilities so, for the first time in her life, Arcueid was experienced what it meant to be genuinely aroused...</p><p>Vahn had even been able to get a rise out of Eva in the past so, with more than a hundred years of additional experience, Arcueid was practically putty in his hands. His understanding of Petting Laws, his mastery of [Hands of Nirvana], and his Divinity related to Sex only made the process even easier. It only took a few minutes before her garments were completely soaked through with sweat as he was proactively using his Source Energy to seal away her natural regeneration. It would only be more painful for her if she was stuck in a cycle of endlessly losing her virginity so he had to do at least this much to make Arcueid's first experience a pleasant memory.</p><p>As could be expected of a maiden, Arcueid wasn't able to keep up with what was happening to her body. Everything she was experiencing was so far beyond her expectations that she could only bite on her finger to prevent herself from crying out. Even this was denied to her after a while, however, as Vahn gently pulled her hand away and, after kissing her fingers a few times, stated, "It is okay to cry out. Here, in this place, you can be as loud as you like..."</p><p>From then onward, Vahn's ego was padded by Arcueid's sonorous cries, each urging him to continue in his endeavors. This sound eventually became a crescendo when he lifted Arcueid's waist so that it was level with his face, his tongue sampling the sacred honeypot that had never known another in more than eight-hundred years. As could be expected from a Greater Divine Spirit, the flavor was far removed from the norm, its quality closer to ambrosia than anything remotely resembling the bodily fluids of a human...</p><p>Though he couldn't actually get drunk, Vahn felt like he was being brought closer to intoxication the longer his tongue entwined with Arcueid's insides. Her aroma and flavor were spreading through his head, numbing his senses and causing his entire body to heat up. Despite this, he continued probing her insides with his inordinately long tongue, determined to bring Arcueid to the peak.</p><p>Feeling something rising up from deep inside her body, Arcueid was attacked by what could only be described as existential dread. Her thighs locked around Vahn's head but, despite her fear, she just clenched the bedspread tightly as her back began to arch. Then, like a floodgate being shattered, a phenomenal wave of pleasure spread throughout her entire body. This caused Arcueid to cry out with enough force to shake the surrounding void, fracturing the crystalline structure of the room she had made.</p><p>Being located near ground-zero, Vahn was obviously not spared in the wake of Arcueid's first climax. Her thighs suddenly became harder than steel as the pressure enveloping his head increased with a truly irresistible force. It didn't matter how he tried to protect himself as Arcueid's power literally had no upper limit. As a result, his head was squashed like a pancake but, having expected something to happen, Vahn changed his body to a structure similar to a Doppelganger's.</p><p>Fortunately, Arcueid was awash in the echoes of her climax so she hadn't realized the state she had forced Vahn into. This gave him time to use his [Hands of Nirvana], forcibly relaxing her muscles so that he could reform his body and move to the next step. He really didn't have much time to waste as, even with his Source Energy spread throughout her entire body, Arcueid's regeneration would eventually kick in. It was possible to delay this by sending a constant flow of energy into her body but, as a result of their difference in strength, Vahn was actually at a bit of a disadvantage...</p><p>Before he ran out of energy to restrain Arcueid's regeneration, Vahn pried open her legs, an easy feat considering he had already relaxed her muscles. This caused Arcueid to stare back at him, her sapphire-blue eyes glazed over slightly as she rested her forearms against her head. She seemed to understand his intentions so, after a few seconds had passed, her body began to tremble madly as she gave him a small nod.</p><p>With Arcueid's consent, Vahn smiled lovingly back at her while simultaneously rubbing her abdomen. He didn't even need to imagine what would happen once Arcueid's infinite strength activated while he was inside her so, to avoid that rather graphic scene, Vahn was relaxing her muscles. He also went ahead and dulled her pain receptors as chastity protected for more than eight-hundred years wasn't something easily relinquished...</p><p>When everything was prepared, Arcueid had basically become an endless spring of honey, coating Vahn's member and thighs from proximity alone. It was honestly a sight to behold but, with a duty to perform, Vahn traced his glans along the almost perfect line between her vulva before probing the steamy folds. Then, finding the pulsating entrance within, he moved his hips forward while tracing his hand along Arcueid's abdomen. He was timing his movement with the forceful relaxation of her muscles so, despite being a virgin, there wasn't much resistance until Vahn tore through a flexible membrane.</p><p>Despite his efforts to relax her body, Arcueid somehow managed to completely ignore his efforts. The moment she lost her virginity, her body tensed up with tremendous force as an indescribable pressure threatened to crush his member. To Vahn's surprise, however, his faithful companion was mystically able to resist this force, almost as if it had become indestructible. He could see a vibrant rainbow-hue coming from where they were connected, bringing a knowing smile to his face as he waited for Arcueid to relax. When she finally calmed down, aided by a very long session of kissing, he began to make love to her, continuing for more than three hours. Though he had been worried about running out of energy in the beginning, Vahn quickly learned that his Sex Divinity wasn't something to be looked down upon. In much the same way as Freya, Syr, and Lefiya, he was able to keep going almost indefinitely as, the more into it Arcueid got, the more 'sexual' energy flowed back into him...</p><p>(A/N: Alternate Titles: 'Filling the void of loneliness...','There are times in a man's life where he must act, consequences be damned...!','The indomitable Rainbow Dragon~!')</p><p>https://bit.ly/2XBzAYu &lt;-(p.atreon link)</p><p>paypal.me/Einlion</p><p>Discord Invite: https://discord.gg/Jwa8PKh</p></main><div class="link-group"><a class="btn" href="01340.html">Previous</a><a class="btn" href="index.html">Table of Contents</a><a class="btn" href="01342.html">Next</a></div></div><div id="readpos">0%</div></body></html>
