<p>After nearly seven hours of flight time, Vahn stepped onto the tarmac of the London International Airport before taking a deep breath of the mana-rich air. Though the overall density was a far cry compared to Avalon's, it was still much more comfortable than the stagnant and polluted air in New York.</p><p>Seeing Vahn's relaxed look, Luvia giggled to herself before extending her hand out so that Vahn could help her down. Though she had been able to recover enough to walk, her movement was still restricted greatly. If not for the fact she was reinforcing her legs with Magecraft, she might not even be able to stand without resting for a few days.</p><p>Dutifully taking Luvia's hand, Vahn helped guide her onto the tarmac before they alighted towards a motorcade waiting at the side. Siegfried, Kenshin, and Lakshmibai were already waiting for them, with Kenshin even being the one to open the door for their entry.</p><p>Vahn wasn't too fond of traveling by plane or car but, as it was still too early for him to begin making a scene, he followed Luvia's advice on the matter. Since her forces also needed time to mobilize and make preparations, it was easier on them if he slowed his pace in non-emergency situations.</p><p>Fortunately, while traveling in such a way was rather boring, Vahn didn't have to worry too much as he was in good company. He actually liked pampering his women and, during the long trip over the Atlantic, Luvia had continued to pester him about what he had done to her body. Since she wasn't really mad, he found her behavior rather adorable, allowing her to take some small advantages of him.</p><p>Due to how early in the morning it was, close to 4 AM, the roads were relatively empty so the trip towards the Edelfelt Mansion was shorter than normal. Vahn also noticed that, despite the fact he shouldn't be all that popular within London, there were only a few probes to try and peer into the cars, none of which seemed to carry truly malicious intent.</p><p>When asked, Luvia giggled mischievously before reminding him that people, for good reason, feared things like Curses and Counter Curses. Since they were in the heart of the Mage's Association, most of the truly dangerous people would be able to mask their intentions. If they lacked this ability, there would be ample ways to deal with them, many perfectly justifiable according to Magus Law.</p><p>Though the information he received wasn't anything particularly new, Vahn was reminded of how deeply rooted the established families were. They were like snakes that had burrowed underground to preserve their strength through a cold winter. Until an opportune moment presented itself, they would continue to lay in wait until their prey was foolish enough to enter their territory.</p><p>For better or worse, Vahn felt his instincts as a hunter kick in at this thought, giving him the urge to pay some of the families a personal visit to see how they would react. Since the Monarchal Families were listed in his Objectives, he figured picking one amongst them would be the fastest method to secure power within the Association. He was looking forward to them antagonizing him in the near future; probably more than he should have...</p><p>As a woman raised in a family that threw themselves onto the frontlines readily, Luvia recognized the glint in Vahn's eye, causing a predatory smile to spread across her face. She was also looking forward to the future as, despite the fact she had lost the battle for the position official Empress, there were ample ways in which she could secure her own power and contribute to the growth of the Empire.</p><p>---</p><p>Despite the fact it was early in the morning, Olivia had been awaiting their arrival. The moment she saw Luvia, she vanished like a phantom but, unlike before, Vahn could easily follow her with his eyes. This caused her to raise her brow slightly while looking at him but, far more interested in the state of her granddaughter, Olivia pulled out a strange black gemstone before placing it near Luvia's navel.</p><p>For a brief moment, Luvia's body tensed up before the gemstone suddenly changed from black to a light shade of red. This actually caused both her and Olivia to become even tenser until, moments later, the gemstone flashed white before turning into dust. Though this also stunned them quite a bit, Luvia seemed to regain her strength after a few seconds, tackling him full force as she shouted, "As expected of my Vaaaahn~! Ohohohoho~"</p><p>Understanding Vahn's confusion, Olivia explained, "You can look down on us for it if you want, but that little black gemstone is a common item within the established families. It is a rare mineral that can measure the fate of an individual even as a fertilized ovum. We call it Potentiaalikivi in our home country but the Mage's Association calls it the Stone of Fate.</p><p>The moment Vahn heard the explanation, Sis had already located the item within the system shop, showing it had a value of 7,000OP. This was actually cheaper than he expected but, considering it seemed to be a single-use item, without any meaningful benefits, it made sense.</p><p>Seeing Vahn's tame reaction, Olivia began to snicker before explaining, "You don't seem surprised by the fact the gemstone broke. It is actually a big deal and, if the Mage's Association learned of it, at least in normal circumstances, they would put a Sealing Designation on both you and Luvia. A child with the potential to break a Potentiaalikivi theoretically has no limits to their growth."</p><p>Luvia nodded her head in affirmation, albeit while stroking her cheek against his, but Vahn was still acting casually as he smiled in response and said, "Not just my children, but everyone has unlimited potential. In some situations, it is just harder to tap into. Rather than a god, I will elevate my children to the point that gods aspire to reach the same heights."</p><p>Hearing Vahn's bold statement, neither woman seemed too surprised but Luvia, already hanging on his body with renewed strength, was beginning to heat up. Fortunately, she had the wherewithal to release him before things became disastrous for her, earning a 'knowing' look from her grandmother that caused her face to flush even redder. Then, perhaps trying to get a rise out of both of them, she looked towards Vahn with a predatory look similar to the one Luvia would sometimes display, saying, "If I were a few years younger, I might take a bite out of you myself. It is unfortunate that I've already left things to the current generation~."</p><p>Vahn just laughed in a lighthearted manner after hearing Olivia's words and, though he was tempted to pay her a compliment about her beauty, despite her age, he ultimately kept mum. He knew she wasn't joking around when she said such things so, to avoid a situation where he was attacked by multiple generations of Edelfelts, it was better to just laugh it off. Though this caused Oliva to squint her eyes toward him, Vahn was confident she wouldn't try to harm her granddaughter's position by acting on her 'instincts'.</p><p>---</p><p>As they couldn't talk about it through traceable means, Luvia disclosed everything he had previously told her to Olivia over breakfast. He didn't particularly mind this, as it wasn't intended to be a secret from his allies, so he dutifully gave clarifying answers when questioned. As could be expected, Olivia was more than a little interested in the existence of the Quest Board, saying, "I would like to see this Quest Board for myself. If it is how you describe, I believe it is in the interest of the Empire and the Edelfelt family to take full advantage of such a wondrous opportunity. I'd like to send a group of our family's Elites to begin accepting Quests to see how rapidly their strength can be increased. As we're already involved in various matters all over the world, it would also provide you with ample data."</p><p>Since Vahn had already discussed something similar with Luvia during the plane ride, he nodded his head in affirmation before saying, "Luvia will be bringing her own escort to tend to her needs within the castle. It will still be some time until the Empire is ready to accept too many outsiders, regardless of whether they are allies. There are a lot of changes that will be occurring in the near future but, at the very least, I can accept those of Edelefelt blood and their direct subordinates."</p><p>Without arguing against it, Olivia gave an understanding nod before stating, "Umu, that is for the best. The Empire shouldn't be so easily accessible before you manage to cement your foundation."</p><p>Understanding full well the issues with allowing a 'foreign' power into your midst before you had a functioning hierarchy, Oliva didn't try to press the issue at all. She trusted Luvia's judgment and, with it being obvious they had already discussed the matter, she would leave it at that. Just being able to see and use the Quest Board for herself was more than enough, at least for the time being.</p><p>Since Lord Animusphere would be arriving around lunchtime, Vahn made the decision to return to Avalon to address the matter of the Quest Board as soon as possible. Before then, Luvia gathered a group of Maids and, though it was unnecessary, a Chef. This wasn't because she didn't like the food served in Avalon, but more so to make them either learn how to cook from Circe or raise their Skill through the Quest Board. As there was indeed a [Cooking] Skill, it would only be a matter of time before the curiously blue-haired Chef was able to reach a level of mastery others would struggle to imagine.</p><p>To prevent any 'issues', Luvia's entourage was entirely comprised of females as, despite the fact they were all Elites in their own right, the entire purpose of their stay in Avalon was to attend her. Though there were numerous trustworthy Butlers and male combat Elites, Luvia was aware of the presence of Homunculi within the castle and simply wanted to avoid causing any unnecessary trouble. Since she was also aware that Vahn would be summoning more males in the near future, Luvia was considering playing matchmaker between her attendants and some of Vahn's present and future subordinates.</p><p>Currently, the only males within the entirety of Avalon, besides a number of Fae, were Vahn, Merlin, Siegfried, and Heracles. When they had discussed the upcoming summons, however, Vahn informed her that Heracles' family, consisting of two sons, combined with Karna, Gawain, and, if he had the resources, Galahad. Though she didn't quite agree with summoning these particular individuals, as there were a number of more 'useful' Heroic Spirits, Luvia wasn't going to press the issue. What she was more concerned about was establishing more connections between her family and the Empire, ensuring they would continue being allies into the far future.</p><p>---</p><p>Upon returning to Avalon, Vahn informed Kenshin and Lakshmibai that they would be staying for at least a day, allowing the two to return and rest properly. As for Siegfried, he accompanied the group to the Knight's Training Grounds as it was both the location of his home and the Quest Board. In his past life, he had done his best to fulfill the wishes of others so, having a convenient board that would allow him to serve the Empire was of significance to him. His travels around the world with Luvia had awakened the spirit of a Hero that had been slumbering inside of him. Now, in order to make Vahn's dream of a better world a reality, he wanted to contribute more than just protecting the Empire and its residents.</p><p>With Siegfried's inclusion, the group had a total of nine people, a Companion, and a fat black cat. By the time they reached the Knight's Training Grounds, however, the total had increased to twelve as, with Fenrir always knowing when and where he was, she brought over Mordred and Sakura with her.</p><p>Thus, while carrying Sakura and letting Mordred ride his shoulders, the most common way in which they traveled together, Vahn led the way to the Quest Board as Olivia and Luvia's entourage looked around the castle in awe.</p><p>After reaching the large black slab of stone, Vahn set Sakura on the ground but Mordred continued to ride on his shoulders, leaning against the top of his head with a toothy grin. Since it had been a few days since their last meeting, at least from the perspective of Mordred, Vahn decided to spoil her a bit. As for Sakura, she was decidedly more mature than her older sister so, after looking toward the latter with a concerned expression, she let the matter lay while even demonstrating how to use the Quest Board for the rest of the group.</p><p>Following Sakura's example, Luvia and Olivia both placed their palms against the warm black stone but, as could be expected, Quests only appeared for the former. This caused Olivia to give a curt nod and, after helping Luvia select Quests she would be able to complete without endangering her child, she turned to Vahn, asking, "Your Majesty...we are more or less family at this point, correct? If it is not too much trouble, I would like to have your Familia Crest inscribed in the near future."</p><p>Having expected this request, Vahn gave a curt nod before explaining, "That is my intention. I can do the same for Luvia's entourage, but only if you are able to tolerate the presence of my Empress and her attendant." As he didn't trust himself to be alone in a room with Olivia and Luvia, for a variety of different reasons, Vahn intended to use Artoria and Gray as his shield. This didn't go unnoticed by either of the golden-haired women, eliciting a mischevious laugh from both of them as they looked toward him with predatory eyes.</p><p>Noticing the way her Chichue was being looked at, Mordred glared at Olivia and Luvia in response, even though they were just playing around. This caused Olivia's expression to turn somewhat serious as, for a brief moment, she felt very real killing intent from the small child. As for Luvia, she faired better than her grandmother as, having met and conversed with Mordred a few times, the latter had already 'accepted' her presence around Vahn.</p><p>Since he could feel the change in Mordred, Vahn shrugged his shoulders slightly, causing Mordred to bounce before she snorted through her nose and adopted a pouting expression while looking away. This allowed Olivia to breathe easier, causing her to lightly pat her chest as she remarked, "I see your daughter as the potential to be a powerful Knight in the future. I'm certain she makes you very proud, Your Majesty~."</p><p>Though she had been pouting before, Mordred's ears twitched in response to Olivia's words before a toothy grin replaced her dour expression. She began to rub the back of her head while puffing out her non-existent chest as she proudly claimed, "I am Chichiue's eldest child! I will also be the one to become Emperor in the future! Just you wait, shishishishi~"</p><p>Seeing how easily Mordred was baited by Olivia's words, Vahn issued a light chuckle while Olivia and Luvia did the same. At the side, Fenrir looked at her young protege with a prideful look of her own while, standing next to her, Sakura had a 'tired' look as she shook her head. She had spent every day at her onee-chan's side over the last few months so she had already grown used to her carefree and rather 'simple' nature. Still, after shaking her head in mild exasperation, Sakura adopted a supportive smile as she looked up to her onee-chan quite a bit.</p><p>---</p><p>After a small welcoming feast, cooked by Circe as Luvia's Chef dutifully took notes and provided as much assistance as she was able, Vahn found himself in the Medical Ward where he treated the Homunculi. Artoria, Gray, and Sakura were present as he inscribed his Familia Crest on the 'obedient' Olivia. She knew better than to act out around Vahn's Empress as, even if she could get away with it, forming any bad blood would just complicate things in the future. Since Artoria had a very serious disposition, Olivia didn't want to test the waters only to discover it was an acid bath.</p><p>-------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p>[Status]</p><p>Name: [Olivia Kulta Edelfelt]</p><p>Age: 97</p><p>Race: Human</p><p>Strength: 24C</p><p>Endurance: 17D</p><p>Agility: 19D</p><p>Magical Power: 8E</p><p>Good Luck: 39B</p><p>Circuit Quality: 28C</p><p>Noble Phantasm: (-)</p><p>Origin: War, Fortune, Wealth</p><p>Skills: [Fang of the Wolf God:Innate:S], [Call of the Battlefield:Innate:A], [Herald of Fortune:Innate:C], [Golden Rule:B], [Martial Arts:A], [Marksmanship:S], [Presence Concealment:C], [Etiquette:A], [Dancing:B]</p><p>Magic: (-)</p><p>Magecraft: [Od Conversion:S], [Conversion:A], [Catalyze:A], [Jewel:A], [Reinforce:A], [Mystic Code:A], [Magic Coat:B], [True Gandr:E~S], [Counter Curse:A], [Restoration:C], [Familiar:E], [Projection:D], [Alchemy:A]</p><p>[Marksmanship]</p><p>Rank: S</p><p>Use: Skill and accuracy with ranged weapons.
