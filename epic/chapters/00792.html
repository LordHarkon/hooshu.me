<p>After leaving behind an exceptionally fired up Nanu, Vahn spent a bit of time idling around while thinking about his next course of action. In the distance, he could see some of the girls training hard, a common sight that could generally be seen at any time throughout the day. Since the general sleeping schedule of everyone was thrown out of whack by the existence of the orb, there always seemed to be someone awake and active. If not for the clock tower that had been constructed in the center of the orb, displaying the time in the outside world, it would be very difficult to keep meal times scheduled...</p><p>Vahn was currently considering if he should try to approach Shizune, as she was one of the girls who had been 'waiting' on him for quite a long time. It felt strange to cycle through the girls that he had yet to consummate his relationship with, but it was unlikely that she would mind. In fact, Vahn suspected she would probably turn into something of a carnivorous woman the moment he gave her the 'okay'.</p><p>Though she had her body reverted in the past, giving her the appearance of a ten-year-old girl, Shizune still had the mind of a mature woman who had spent several years as both a slave and prostitute. Now, she was even older, having a chronological age of more than twenty-three years old. She had also been using the nutritional supplements to help bolster her growth but still looked a little on the young end, though not nearly as much as Ais had in the past. Presently, she was around 155cm tall, just six centimeters short than her adult height of 161cm. Though her breasts hadn't really been keeping up with her growth, as she was currently much smaller than the pert B-Cups she had in the past, it was hard to say she wasn't ready for a physical relationship...</p><p>Thinking till here, Vahn released a small sigh and made his way towards the southern section of the orb, seeing a small shrine-like house sitting atop a hill. With Terra's influence, the majority of the orb was filled with grass and, at least towards the center region, there were numerous trees that had been planted to liven up the atmosphere. Here atop the hill where Shizune typically resided, however, there was a bit of a chill in the air and the majority of the surrounding region was filled with muted black grass, a unique species called [Shade of Dusk].</p><p>A single bag of seeds had cost a total of 500,000OP, but it allowed for a small amount of Shadow, Darkness, and Yin energy to naturally disseminate into the surroundings. Because of this, it had been segmented off from the surrounding areas and, as it was very beneficial for their own skills and abilities, girls like Shizune, Chloe, and Haruhime often spent their idle time inside the small cottage located in the very center of the black patch of grass. Since it had been proposed by Shizune and Haruhime in the past, both hailing from the far east, it had the appearance of a small shrine with a red roof that came to a point at the top and curled ornately at the edges. They had actually put in a lot of effort to build it themselves, though Tsubaki had helped out a fair amount.</p><p>Passing through the stark red torii gate that was located at the edge of the grass' boundary, Vahn noticed that two of the presences within the shrine immediately reacted to him. A small smile spread across his lips as one of them 'disappeared' and he could suddenly sense an anomaly within his own shadow before Shizune popped up behind him and wrapped her arms a little seductively around his body. He could smell a fragrant perfume wafting from her body as she inclined her head upon his shoulder and mused, "Have you come to eat me up now, Vahn~?"</p><p>Since he hadn't really been discreet about his actions over the last two days, Vahn wasn't surprised that Shizune had been 'expecting' his arrival. Tina had also been fidgetting around a lot at meals and Risna had even shown up at dinner with a red face as the other girls looked toward her with amused smiles. Even Eina had entered into the orb after the fact, which was very rare for her, and spent a few hours talking with her sister in the privacy of the latter's room. Thus, Vahn wasn't really that surprised by Shizune's behavior, nor by the fact that Haruhime was currently sneaking out through the back of the shrine, likely to give them 'privacy'.</p><p>Suddenly, Vahn felt himself sinking into his shadow as Shizune pulled herself up and began to nibble on his ear. It seemed that, even before he had said anything, she was already fully prepared for what was to come, causing Vahn to withhold a sigh as he pulled himself free of the shadow and turned to face her. The moment he saw what Shizune was wearing, Vahn felt his brain buzz slightly because the only clothing on her body was a loose red kimono that wasn't tied together, displaying Shizune's intricate black bra and panties. She was also wearing a black choker with a small golden bell while her dark brown hair was tied up into a loose bun, held together with two chopstick-like hairpins...</p><p>With a slightly flushed face and a simultaneously eager and serious expression, Shizune stared back at him with her amethyst eyes and said, "Vahn...I have been waiting for this for a long time...please, don't hold back..." While speaking, Shizune had walked forward, wrapping her arms around his body and pressing her developing breasts against him as she buried her face into his chest, muttering, "You gave me back my life, Vahn...this body, and everything that I am today...I want to dedicate them to you. The only thing I ask for in exchange..." Turning her face up to match his gaze, Vahn noticed that there was a deeply rooted pain showing through in Shizune's eyes as she said, "I want you to help me forget...if it's you, I believe you can do it..."</p><p>Even without her explaining in any great detail, Vahn knew exactly what Shizune wanted him to overwrite for her. She had been taken from her village at a very young age, raped by a band of scoundrels, sold into slavery, and then worked as both a slave and prostitute for nearly half her life. Though she now had a life that many people would envy, it hadn't come without her have to pay an unfair price. Now, she was asking him to completely overwrite the existence of all the men who had used her body to satiate their cruel desires for so many years...a daunting task, but something Vahn had full confidence in seeing through till the end.</p><p>With his left hand, Vahn brought it up and began stroking Shizune's dark brown fox ears, having a slight curve and tufts of white hair on the inside. At the same time, he moved his right hand into her open kimono and brought it around to the small of her back, right above her tail. Shizune, sadly accustomed to the touch of others, didn't show any signs of nervousness and simply tip-toed to meet his lips with her own. It wasn't the first time they had kissed, but there was a great deal more passion this time around as Vahn slowly guided her into the shrine without breaking free from her rather skillful and aggressive little tongue...</p><p>Once they were inside, Vahn maneuvered Shizune over to the small size room where there was a thick futon with purple blankets. Shizune herself had started to heat up a little bit, the result of the fact that she was a virgin and her instincts were beginning to trigger in expectation. Vahn knew she didn't want to have a child so soon, but knowing that her body was eagerly preparing itself for insemination always got him a little riled up. This was a unique quality of many of the Beast Human girls and it was always especially intense during their first times. Shizune's own excitement was also increasing very quickly, as she was the most aware of what was going on with her body and it made her feel strangely happy to have this kind of reaction that she couldn't control...</p><p>Since she wanted him to 'overwrite' her past experiences, Vahn decided to take a different approach than normal and, instead of giving her the opportunity to use her skills, Vahn decided to take the lead and 'service' her instead. After guiding her down to the futon, and taking a few seconds to marvel at her sensuous and still developing figure, especially the long brown tail poking up between her thighs, Vahn smiled and said, "I will take everything, Shizune...all of the bad memories, the tragic fate you had to experience, and the worries you have about the future...I will take them into myself and, in exchange, give you as much happiness as it takes to fill in the places where those memories had previously resided..."</p><p>Shizune's amethyst eyes never broke away from Vahn's gaze, even as his hands began to wander around her body, each place they traveled being infused with an energy that made her heart race. She desperately wanted to believe in Vahn's words and, after interacting with the other girls for the last few years, Shizune was confident he would be able to heal her wounded heart and mind. Still, though she had been looking forward to this day for a long time, Shizune was surprised to find that she was actually a little scared...she didn't know how she needed to act, nor how her body would react after they had started...for the first time in a long time, Shizune didn't know what she was supposed to do while having sex...</p><p>Seeing a few tendrils of purple waving around in Shizune's aura, Vahn's expression softened further and, as gently as he could manage, whispered, "Shizune..." Though she had already been looking at him, Vahn noticed her 'focus' had increased when she heard him call her name. This made Vahn's smile curl up slightly as he continued, "I love you...Shizune..." For a brief moment, Vahn saw even more purple in Shizune's aura but he just continued saying, "I love you, Shizune..." while moving his hands around her body, avoiding any of the more delicate areas for the time being...</p><p>Slowly but surely, Shizune began to calm down and relax, releasing a hot sigh before she finally smiled and said, "I love you too, Vahn..." This time, Vahn's smile turned radiant because he genuinely was happy to hear her say those words. He had already repeated his more than ten times and, though he was determined to do whatever it took to make her happy, a strange feeling had started to flutter around in his heart when she didn't say it back. Her words had caused that feeling to go away and, perhaps as a result of his own happy smile, Shizune's blossomed into a truly beautiful one in response.</p><p>Vahn didn't know how many steps it would take for Shizune to fully recover, but it was nice to know they had at least taken the first step together. At the same time that her expression had turned into a more natural smile, Vahn slowly moved his palms up her sides, diffusing a mixture of petting energy and stimulating energy from his [Hands of Nirvana]. Shizune took a deep breath through her nose as his thumbs came to the bottom of her bra and moved it up, revealing the pale white breasts and muted cherry-red buds, standing proudly and excitedly as his eyes fell upon them. Vahn resisted the urge to chuckle, as he knew girls were sometimes self-conscious about the size of their breasts, and just gently traced his fingers around them as Shizune rested her head against the futon with her eyes closed.</p><p>After seeing that the petting energy in her body had built up to an adequate level, ensuring that Shizune would be both calm and relaxed, even while sexually excited, Vahn lightly pinched the two protrusions. Her brows furrowed slightly as Shizune's body twitched, a sensual moan escaping her lips that had surprised Vahn a little. Though he knew his skills had reached a 'dangerous' level, Vahn hadn't really done anything elicit such a response from her just yet. Still, he didn't allow his surprise to show on his face as his mind rationalized what must have happened...</p><p>Since Shizune had dealt with a lot of men in the past, she had built up a habit of trying to appeal to them in order to ease her own burdens. There were men that liked the 'challenge' of conquering strong women so many prostitutes, especially those that were slaves, acted in a contrary manner. Instead of showing any real resistance, they were typically very forward in both their actions, gestures, and even their reactions. It was essentially an 'act' that was meant to both rile up their partner but also cause them to wrap things up rather quickly since the increased tensions would generally make men spend their stamina faster than more intimate sex...</p><p>Realizing that Shizune was defaulting back to her past reactions, Vahn felt a little sad for her but promised he would change her perception towards sex, to the point that her body and heart reacted honestly. Thus, with that in mind, Vahn put a little more energy into his fingertips and began tracing them around Shizune's upper body, breasts, and abdomen. The entire time, her body was becoming increasingly flushed and, after a few minutes, she had opened her watery eyes to watch what he was doing. It wasn't the first time she had received a massage from Vahn, but Shizune had expected things to develop a little faster than this...though it was very pleasant, almost to the point she didn't want it to ever end, Shizune wanted something 'more' at this moment...</p><p>Vahn felt Shizune's tail curl up between his legs and begin to stroke his back as she tried, and failed, to lift her body towards him. This caused her to laugh slightly as she playfully said, "It will be difficult to show off my skills if I can't move~." To her surprise, however, Vahn nodded his head, explaining, "We will have our entire lives to do things like that, Shizune...this is your first time, so I will make it a pleasant experience you'll remember fondly, even if hundreds of years were to pass...after all..." At this point, Vahn pulled Shizune into a seated position, hugging her body as he whispered into her ears once again, "I love you..."</p><p>This time, Shizune's body trembled lightly and Vahn couldn't help smiling when he saw her ear flicker from his words. Unable to resist the urge, Vahn lightly blew into the tuft of fuzzy white fur sticking out of her ear, causing it to flicker again as Shizune lightly headbutted his chest in defiance. This time, Vahn released a silent chuckle and began to quickly press around spots on Shizune's back, his intent to place small 'seeds' of source energy in each of her nerves. When he used different techniques later on, these seeds would resonate with his energy and greatly increase both the potency and duration of the massage's effect. This was the technique he had developed that pushed his [Hands of Nirvana] to SS-Rank, so it was actually a skill that 'exceeded' the realm of mortals and could even 'conquer' gods...</p><p>Shizune didn't really know what to make of the current situation, other than the fact it felt like her body wasn't even her own at this point. It was hard to describe her current emotions, other than explaining it as 'happiness building up inside of her body till the point it felt like it would explode'. Though she was still turned on, almost to a scary amount, the pleasant and relaxing feelings suffused through her entire body were almost mindbogglingly overwhelming. Other than taking deep breaths through her mouth, as there was a fair amount of fluid draining from her nose, Shizune didn't even know what she could do at this moment. Other than 'feeling', she couldn't really form any thoughts and, other than the powerful warmth radiating from Vahn's body, Shizune was hardly even aware of anything other than what she was experiencing right now...</p><p>He had never experienced it himself, but Vahn had a good idea of what Shizune was going through, as he had used this technique, named 'Rapture', on Freya, Hephaestus, Loki, Hestia, Anubis, Eirene, and Demeter. It put them in what they described as a state of 'supreme bliss' that could even forcefully activate their divine power, even without their intent. This was because it forced the recipient to enter their most natural state, unable to truly form any thoughts as their body was entirely focused on the 'experience of existence' itself. Vahn wanted to use this technique to do exactly as Shizune had asked, overwriting her past experiences by making it completely impossible to even think about anything other than this moment they shared together...</p><p>After nearly a half hour had passed, Shizune was lying limply in his arms as her head rested against his shoulder, a trail of slobber having caused a large stain to spread across his tunic. Even though this was the case, Vahn knew that Shizune was very 'aware' right now, even if she was also in a highly receptive state. If he chose to, Vahn knew he could use this technique to effectively hypnotize and potentially even brainwash other people. Doing so, however, would earn him a potentially monstrous amount of negative karma so Vahn just allowed Shizune to make her own decisions in this state and just chose a few guiding words to lead her along.</p><p>As she was already sitting in his lap, straddling his waist, Vahn pulled Shizune away from his shoulder and supported her body as he gently called, "Shizune..." Her head, which had been dangling previously, slowly raised to meet his gaze, a small amount of clarity returning to her amethyst purple eyes. Once again, this time with as much love and affection as he could manage, Vahn smiled and repeated, "I love you..." Though it took a few seconds, Shizune's dazed expression melted into a smile of her own as she spoke out in a soft, bell-like voice, "I love you, Vahn..."</p><p>Vahn allowed his smile to expand naturally before he leaned in slightly and waited for Shizune to pick up on what was going on. Realization seemed to hit her a few seconds later and, without him having to lean in and kiss her himself, Shizune brought her lips to meet. Her thin and willowy arms wrapped somewhat awkwardly around his neck as their kiss grew progressively more passionate, with Shizune taking the initiative. Right now, her body was responding honestly, almost to an extreme extent. When she pulled away to catch her breath, there was a little more clarity in her eyes as she said in an emotional voice, "I love you so much..."</p><p>With an even bigger smile on his face, Vahn nodded his head and just reached his arms around to hug her firmly in his embrace, stroking the back of her head as he said, "I know...I'm sorry for making you wait so long...I promise to make it up to you in the future..." With his own words sounding through the room, followed by several seconds of silence, Vahn continued to hug Shizune's body and try to show her the comfort she had deserved long ago. It was truly unfair that her childhood had been robbed from her, replaced by a tragic fate forced upon her by terribly cruel people...</p><p>Though the silence continued, Shizune slowly put more strength into her own embrace and, somewhat against his expectations, she began to grind against him slightly. Vahn knew this was her honest desire and it felt a little awkward since he had expected things to go a little differently. However, without letting it knock him off kilter, Vahn instead moved his head over and nibbled on the pointed tip of Shizune's fox-like ears. She twitched and began to wriggle around a little before turning her head and trying to free her ear from his mouth, muttering, "Don't tease my ears, Vahn~"</p><p>Vahn released a light chuckle, freeing Shizune's ear at the same time while the Kitsune in question released a small sigh and put on a pouting expression. Once again, against his expectations, Shizune turned her face away from him and just tightened her grip around him while she rocked her lower body in a circular motion. Since he knew what she wanted, Vahn finally unequipped his clothing and could now feel the moist fabric of Shizune's silk panties grinding against him while her soft butt straddled his member. She stopped her movements after noticing the change and, surprising him for a third time, began to gently suckle on his nipple as she traced her tongue around it...</p><p>As he was very accustomed to such things, primarily as a result of Chloe, Arnya, Aki, and Milan, Vahn recovered quickly and moved his right hand to the base of Shizune's tail. Though the tail itself flickered in response to his touch, Shizune herself took a few seconds to process what was happening. Her own actions came to a stop as her forehead rested against his chest for a few seconds, her breathing the only discernable sound, though her heart seemed to be trying to make its presence known. Then, after nearly twenty seconds had passed, Shizune lifted her face, revealing an amorous blush as she lifted up her butt and allowed his glans to trace her panties until coming to a stop at a very hot and moist spot...</p><p>(A/N: Alternate Titles: 'Yin Fox Shrine','Seriously, people who peddle other people as goods, especially children, deserve the worst kind of death','A fox maiden's earnest plea...make the bad memories go away (T^T)...;)</p><p>https://bit.ly/2XBzAYu &lt;-(p.atreon link)</p><p>paypal.me/Einlion</p><p>Discord Invite: https://discord.gg/Jwa8PKh</p></main><div class="link-group"><a class="btn" href="00791.html">Previous</a><a class="btn" href="../index.html">Table of Contents</a><a class="btn" href="00793.html">Next</a></div></div><div id="readpos">0%</div></body></html>
