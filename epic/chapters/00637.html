<p>Tiona was currently standing at the center of everyone, wearing a sleeveless white top that hugged her figure, almost as if 'proving' she didn't have any breasts. It had a collar the came partially up her neck and was split at the bottom like four flower petals with black accents along the edges. She also had a pair of loose sleeves that started around her biceps and reached all the way to her wrists, where the accessories that used to be there had completely vanished. Slightly darker than her mint colored hair, Tiona had a teal skirt that matched the color of the bow at her chest and the two small ribbons tying up the two cute pigtails in her hair. On her legs, she had dark green stockings that flowed directly into her boots, much like how Ais' and Mikoto's used to...</p><p>When Tione jumped up and shouted, everyone in the room was startled by the outburst until Tiona just looked at her sister and said, "Ehehehe, Tiona had become a magical girl, Tione~!" As if to demonstrate, Tiona swung the small star-shaped wand in her hand and sent out sparkling magical energy that was shaped like glitter, stars, and even hearts. One of them flew at Tione, popping as it came into contact with her face, startling the elder of the two Amazon sisters in the process. Tiona saw this and began to laugh happily before eyeing Vahn with her star-shaped pupils and saying, "Vahn, my hero~!" as she leaped towards him.</p><p>Vahn was very surprised by the transformation but he put it to the back of his mind and just accepted Tiona's embrace since she seemed very happy. He did, however, ask, "Do you know how to transform back...?" after a few minutes had passed. Tiona nodded her head before backing away and holding the wand between her hands, causing her clothing to 'explode' into light green smoke as her previous equipment thankfully came back into existence. Vahn released a relieved sigh before smiling as he said, "That wand is now bound to you and should enable you to use all kinds of magic, though it wouldn't necessarily follow conventional magic systems. You'll have to figure out how to use it yourself, but I'm certain you'll be able to do it, Tiona."</p><p>Tiona began laughing happily as she brandished the wand and said, "It was actually super easy to use magic when I was transformed, almost like my brain was telling me how to do it. I still want to learn properly though, so please teach me~!" Vahn agreed to her request and they all began to talk about their studies while Vahn began transcribing books for the girls. Strangely, though he couldn't see the difference between languages, Vahn could write in Latin just fine. The only thing he needed to do was know it existed and analyze the structure for a bit before he could completely replicate the language. It also helped that he had a template to work from with the texts provided by Eva and Terra.</p><p>Since it had started to get late, Vahn had the girls go to sleep since they needed to prepare for the Expedition setting out early tomorrow morning. They were all very excited to be learning magic, especially after seeing Tiona suddenly transform, so Vahn had needed to force them to sleep by dispersing calming energy into his domain. He still ended up being hugged by Tiona and Tione while Fenrir claimed the spot on his stomach for herself. As for himself, Vahn stayed awake for a while longer since he wasn't even remotely tired. He had rested a bit in the orb and that had only been a few hours prior, not mentioning the fact he didn't require much sleep from the start. Thus, while waiting for sleep to claim him, Vahn let his mind wander and just enjoyed the warmth of the girls as he wondered what kind of schemes their enemies would enact in the future.</p><p>Though he still had a long way to go, Vahn felt like he would even be able to defeat Ottar if he could catch the powerful demigod off guard. In raw parameters, Vahn was confident in exceeding Ottar completely so the biggest variable would be general combat experience and the strength of the man's Innates. As a demigod, Vahn was certain Ottar had, at the very least, three different Innates. Becoming the 'King' would have been impossible otherwise and he wouldn't have had such a great impact on the original plot unless he had a powerful destiny. He likely had the blessing of his parent god, Innates related to Power and Endurance, and most likely enhanced perception...</p><p>Vahn wondered if he could convince Freya to allow him and Ottar to spar in the future but knew it would probably 'trigger' the goddess to approach him more earnestly if he defeated her prized champion. He would have to settle for fighting against his own companions while periodically having the opportunity to defeat whatever enemies had the 'gall' to actually try and fight them. Other than subterfuge and scheming against them, Vahn couldn't imagine anyone actually being able to threaten his family in the future. If he could adapt Eva's teaching completely, Vahn was confident that even Preasia could become a powerhouse without ever entering the Dungeon. What they were doing was completely reshaping the balance of power in the world, skewing it greatly in their favor until the generations that graduate from the School slowly spread the knowledge in the future...</p><p>Though he hadn't disbelieved it, Vahn now completely understood why Riveria believed he would bring about a magical revolution in the future. It wouldn't spread too quickly, as the children would need to take small vows before taking more advanced magical classes, but the future would be full of capable Mages, Knight, and Magic-Knights. Once the children grew up, they would start their own families while some of the more capable amongst them may even start entire clans, developing completely unique magic that were passed through the ages. Much like the history of Magic in Eva's world, Vahn was confident things would take a similar path in the future as even the gods would likely take to Eva's Magic system once the restrictions of the world's tier had been removed...</p><p>To prevent things from becoming chaotic, Vahn knew he would have to stand at the peak as a deterrent to those that would try to exploit the new magic system for their own benefit. It was likely around this time that he originally set about becoming the 'Emperor' since Vahn could now understand the decision better. Regardless of the path he chose to walk, Vahn would have to help stabilize the other countries or the concepts he spread would eventually be used to bring great harm. The best approach was simply to educate the youth while acting as an insurmountable power that proactively negotiated with the other countries. He could focus his power base within Orario and just wait for things to slowly stabilize or Vahn could take a more 'proactive' approach and seize power from those that have been keeping it for themselves at the expense of others...</p><p>Realizing he was on a similar path as his 'Emperor' self, Vahn produced a wry smile and knew he would have to rely on the others if he didn't want to become 'lonely' again. There was also the fact that he wanted to conquer the Dungeon itself so Vahn knew he would have to restrict his growth to Tier 3, at least until he was ready to move on to the next world. Vahn suspected that he had been unable to obtain the [I Shall Return] quest in the Divination timeline because of the shift in his focus. The moment he was unable to progress further into the Dungeon, Vahn likely lost his method to obtain a large amount of OP and likely required the assistance of the Alliance just to support his reserves.</p><p>This time around, Vahn was confident he could gain more OP by setting up an exchange in the Haven where Adventurers would be able to trade in materials for rare commodities that were relatively cheap within the system shop. It shouldn't be difficult to earn large profits without generating any negative karma as long as he didn't take things too far and develop a greedy mentality. If he kept his focus on stockpiling his reserves for the express purpose of completing his quest and protecting the world, Vahn was confident he would actually generate positive karma instead of negative karma...</p><p>---</p><p>Unsure of when he fell asleep the previous night, Vahn pulled out Eva's orb and quickly entered it before any of the other girls awoke. He was aware that Fenrir stirred awake at the same time as him, but she was behaving and remained silent. Vahn smiled as the darkness encroached on his vision once again before the familiar 'tugging' sensation appeared and he was suddenly in Eva's orb. It felt like he wasn't away for very long and Vahn knew this incongruity would only increase over the next few weeks as he continued learning magic from Eva. It was probably a 'good' thing that he would only be able to use the orb for two weeks since it would become progressively more difficult to focus on things in the real world as his studied progressed further...</p><p>As usual, Eva pinned him down and began licking his exposed shoulder before biting into it, heat radiating from her currently 'adult' form that was straddling his hips. She was 170cm tall in her adult form and appeared to be in her late twenties, seemingly very mature as her large breasts pressed into his chest. Vahn felt like she was trying to appeal to him so he reached out his hands and grabbed her plump butt, not surprised by the fact that she was naked at all. However, Vahn's mind had calmed down a bit at this point and he was aware of the second presence in the room that was near his legs, almost as if she was 'waiting' for something.</p><p>Vahn had been about to remove his pants to 'play' with Eva for a bit but now felt like he had almost walked into a trap orchestrated by the two girls. He wasn't sure what had changed in the last four years but it was almost certain they had become much closer. Deciding to play along, Vahn went with his instincts and drew a sharp breath when his erect member was suddenly enveloped in warmth suddenly, all the way to the base. Eva began laughing at this point, almost like she had succeeded in a prank as she licked his neck and said, "Even though you're on time, we've still been waiting patiently for you, Vahn. You'll have to make it up to us unless you want to be punished again, ufufufu~." Eva began kissing his lips this time, apparently not in a hurry to replenish her mana reserves while Terra 'earnestly' sucked on his member down below.</p><p>Every time Terra pulled her head away, Vahn felt like she was trying to 'rip' his lower body off with how powerful the suction was, causing Eva to laugh every time he drew a sharp breath. Terra's wings also began to rustle audibly, clearly enjoying his response as she redoubled her efforts, rolling his glans with her long and hot tongue before kissing the top and bringing her head down again, craning her head at a somewhat awkward angle to take in the full length into her throat. Vahn knew he was being played with by the two girls, who had likely orchestrated their joint attack previously, but he didn't mind it too much. If things got out of hand, Vahn knew he could at least defeat Terra easily before getting even with Eva later on...</p><p>Eva moved her hips up a little, arching her body as she kissed his lips and asked, "Vahn, do you have any qualms about having sex with Terra?" Vahnn was momentarily stunned by Eva's words, blinking several times before shaking his head and saying, "No, she is a beautiful woman who works very hard for my benefit, sometimes tooooo...hard..." Terra had created a powerful suction, seemingly pleased by Vahn's praise, so his words broke towards the end. As for Eva, she just laughed and began kissing around his cheek and ear as she murmured, "In the future, I'll be expecting you to make up for everything that I can't have right now...but for now, enjoy the comfort of these two big sisters for a bit~." Almost as soon as her words finished, Vahn felt like his penis had entered a furnace as he saw Terra lower her hips while looking down over Eva's back, blue eyes glimmering with passion as she released a steamy sigh.</p><p>There was no immediate tightness to Terra's vagina and it was instead very comfortable, almost like a glove if not for the fact that it was incredibly hot inside. She wasn't at the same level as Hephaestus, but Vahn felt like Terra's insides where nearly 150 degrees and it had surprised him at first. However, it was when Terra tightened up her abdominal muscles that Vahn was truly caught by surprise as he had to grit his teeth to resist being 'crushed' by the sudden pressure. Terra was closely watching his expression and eased up on the pressure a bit until Vahn relaxed, causing her to laugh playfully as she began to rock her hips forward with shallow movements, a fierce blush rising to her cheeks as her breathing began to accelerate.</p><p>Eva grabbed the sides of Vahn's head, forcing him to look at her as she said, "Don't forget about me...or I won't allow this type of thing to happen anymore." Eva had a slight pout on her face because she didn't like being 'ignored' when they had previously been kissing and showing affection to each other. Vahn leaned up and sealed her lips with his own while moving his hands to her hips and placing his thumbs at two points that made her body tremble. At the same time, almost as if they had rehearsed it, Terra pulled Eva's hips down and began rocking the seemingly mature vampire's body, matching her movements to those of her own hips. Vahn keyed in on this fact almost instantly and began stimulating Eva at the same time, not really surprised when her form broke down a few minutes later and he suddenly had her petite body panting against his chest...</p><p>Terra did her best to avoid laughing and just showed a vibrant smile that caused her eyes to squint as she gestured to her Master to pay more attention to Eva. Though they originally were 'attacking' him, things quickly developed to the point where Terra and Vahn were 'tending' to Eva as she fought against the pleasure in her own body. She would likely never grow accustomed to such sensations since her body typically prevented pleasure from building in normal circumstances. With Vahn's constant efforts, however, Eva pooled a large volume of fluids near his lower body that intermixed with Terra's as their 'play' continued for nearly two hours. By the end, Eva had bitten several parts of his body to cope with the sensations wracking her own while Terra had also released a few throaty orgasms, especially when Vahn ejaculated inside of her...</p><p>Eva was currently sitting in Vahn's lap, hugging him while she drained his blood and Terra explained what had happened over the last four years. Since it was a matter that would need to be brought to light sooner or later, Terra started off by explaining, "Master, there is something you need to know..." Presently, she was sitting on Eva's bed without making any effort to conceal herself, even wiping up some of the fluids escaping from her body with a playful glint in her eyes as she licked her fingers clean. Even so, Terra continued explaining, "When you left previously, my body actually released an egg...and it has continued producing one every month since then..."</p><p>Vahn was surprised by Terra's words, especially when she placed her hands affectionately against her abdomen, causing Vahn to immediately activate his [Eyes of Truth]. He had already known the construction of her vagina and womb was 'unique', but Vahn never expected to see what was presently growing inside Terra's body. There was a vibrant, emerald-green, egg that was completely covered in scales inside her womb. The semen that he had ejaculated inside of her body was undergoing a similar process to when he had sex with Elves, being that Terra's womb was absorbing it as it channeled the energy into her egg. Vahn began to sweat at first but took several deep breaths to calm down before smiling, saying, "That is a little sneaky...but I'm not upset. Thank you, Terra..."</p><p>Though he wasn't sure why Vahn felt compelled to thank Terra because he couldn't help but feel she was doing this for 'them'. She probably wanted to produce offspring between them and raise them within the orb, increasing their forces while nurturing their child. Vahn wasn't sure what kind of child would be born but, considering it was currently in an egg, it would likely be a baby True Dragon. The next time he visited the orb, he might have a small dragnoid flittering about, something he found somewhat exciting since Terra would likely teach it how to transform and could probably teach Fafnir later on.</p><p>Terra smiled lovingly when she heard her Master's words, happy he wasn't upset by the fact that she sneakily 'entrapped' him. She had previously discussed this with Eva and had actually been very worried he would resent her, at least for a short while. However, producing infertile eggs had been whittling away at her mentality and Terra felt like she 'needed' to produce a fertile egg or she might lose her mind. She had been preparing to explain this to her Master after the fact but now it suddenly didn't seem as necessary so she just smiled and said, "Master, I love you...I've wanted to tell you that for so long, but now I can't keep it bottled up anymore...ufufufu~."</p><p>Vahn felt a familiar warmth spread through his chest, similar to the feeling he would get whenever the other girls would say the same words. Thus, while hugging Eva's body tightly, Vahn smiled and said, "I love you too, Terra...you and Eva both. I'll also love our child to the best of my ability..." Vahn realized that this meant Terra would be the first person to actually give birth to his child but it didn't really matter too much as the deed was already done. Hephaestus would still be the first person to give birth to his child as part of the Danmachi record and it was unlikely that Terra would make a scene. He didn't even know how things would develop anymore so Vahn just decided not to mind it and simply do his best for all the girls around him, including the small one in his arms and the beautiful big one affectionately stroking her abdomen...</p><p>(A/N: Alternate Titles: 'Gap-moe','Some paths, though different, run parallel to others','Ha, Got'em!')</p><p>https://www.*******.com/user?u=14397149</p><p>paypal.me/Einlion</p><p>Discord Invite: https://discord.gg/Jwa8PKh</p></main><div class="link-group"><a class="btn" href="00636.html">Previous</a><a class="btn" href="../index.html">Table of Contents</a><a class="btn" href="00638.html">Next</a></div></div><div id="readpos">0%</div></body></html>
