<p>For the better part of a minute, there was almost no sound within the area as those with lesser wills had to fight just to keep their consciousness. It wasn't until Vahn had passed his eyes over the entire crowd in turn that the pressure began to ease up. At that same moment, he spoke in a solemn voice that resonated through the entire arena, reaching everyone's ears despite the distance, "We are the Sage Emperor, Vahn Aldrnari Mason. We are not a tyrant but, if you covet what is ours, do not blame us for protecting it."</p><p>In the past, Vahn wouldn't have cared about a few people gawking at his lovers but, now that he had obtained a Divinity related to Sex, it was almost like they were actively catcalling. Since he would not let such grievances slide if he were to hear them, Vahn lacked the magnanimity to tolerate the errant thoughts of the Magi in the crowd. After all, there were many amongst their number who had used things like Hypnosis, Charm, and lesser forms of mind control to act with impunity. He could sense the malicious intent radiating from some people, the largest majority of which belonged to what he assumed to be the Noble Faction.</p><p>Fortunately for the crowd, Zelretch had been close at hand so, after he approached with a wry smile, Vahn gave the crowd some leniency as he turned to the elderly Mage and asked, "We trust this is not the reception the Association had in mind for us, yes? Take us to where we need to be so we can get this farce out of the way."</p><p>Zelretch issued a dry laugh in response to Vahn's words as he slightly regretted bringing the group directly to the arena. He had wanted to give them the chance to make a grand entrance since they cut quite the figure as a group of powerful individuals. Now, Vahn had caused the atmosphere in the arena to become incredibly tense, no doubt earning him the ire of nearly everyone in the crowd.</p><p>During the month leading up to the duel, the Barthomeloi family, and the Noble Faction in general, had been campaigning to demonize Vahn and his Empire quite a bit. They spun the facts to present him as a cruel and uncaring individual who wielded his power with impunity and acted however he pleased. This display would undoubtedly fuel the fires of propaganda further, despite it being clear to many that Vahn was overprotective and borderline possessive, not someone who would give up his allies for something like a wager.</p><p>Vahn didn't care much for pretenses, especially if they required him to simply ignore the faults of wicked individuals. He understood that his actions would have earned him several enemies within the Association but, as this made it easier to identify those with truly malicious intent, he didn't mind borrowing a page out of the Edelfelt's book. His cooperation with the Association was predicated on their willingness to accept the reforms he intended to bring. He would not pander to the Magi that could not accept the changes he would bring so, even if he upset the majority of people belonging to the Association, Vahn showed no remorse...</p><p>By the time Zelretch had escorted Vahn's group to their designated waiting area, many in the crowd had already started speaking in hushed tones. As for those belonging to the Noble Faction, who had borne the brunt of Vahn's aura, they were spewing venom and vitriol as they criticized the 'so-called' Emperor's actions. Some even sent their Servants, other students, to spread the word about what had happened so that everyone else could be informed of the 'truth' of Vahn's tyranny.</p><p>Among those who had witnessed Vahn's display, there was a sealed viewing platform that only those with the highest status among the Noble Faction could make use of. From here, they could view the various duels and events that took place in the arena in extreme comfort. The interior was filled with high-end furniture while the structure of the platform itself was reinforced using materials that could only be found within the various Spiritual Lands. Even if a stray A-Rank attack struck the platform, it would suffer minimal damage while those within wouldn't even feel the smallest of shockwaves.</p><p>Despite these protections, several people seated within the viewing platform had dour expressions as, much like the rest of the Noble Faction, they had borne the brunt of Vahn's pressure. At the front of the group, a tall man and a relatively petite woman, each having hazelnut-brown hair, emanated an aura that caused the interior of the room to tremble slightly.</p><p>While some had felt weak at the knees after experiencing Vahn's pressure, these two stood ramrod straight, hands behind their backs as they raised their heads in a dignified and prideful display. The shorter of the two, despite her diminutive size, gave off the impression of a stable mountain. As for her counterpart, his presence was vast and unfathomable, causing those that met him to feel as though they were looking up at the sky above, awed by the boundless expanse.</p><p>Without changing his posture in the slightest, the man spoke in a deep and stern tone as he stated, "That man is not simple...his aura feels closer to the Divine Energy than mana. You have made quite the enemy for our family, Lorelei."</p><p>If others were to address her by name, Lorelei would harshly rebuke or outright punish them but, this time around, she lowered her head slightly and stated in a solemn tone, "Forgive me, my Lord." She did not try to make any excuses for her actions as, regardless of her haughty and cruel nature, Lorelei was nothing but a little girl when comparing herself to the 'middle-aged' man standing to her right.</p><p>Despite the fact that Lorelei was lowering her head to him, something that shocked everyone else present to the core, the man continued to stand tall without any discernible reaction. It wasn't until several seconds had passed that he stated, "It matters not. Be they God, Divine Spirit, or Magi, our family will emerge victoriously. Recent events have given us the opportunity to show the world why we are considered the most prestigious Magus family. Failure will not be tolerated."</p><p>Still having her head lowered from before, Lorelei answered in a calm and collected tone, without a single sign of lacking confidence, "King or Empress, I will not lose to some relic of the past. My only concern is that you will find the proceedings droll and boring, my Lord."</p><p>This time, there was a slight change in the middle-aged man's, Lord Bathomeloi's, expression. Then, without any hesitation, nor caring for the presence of others, he struck Lorelei across the face with the back of his right hand. A loud smack resonated through the room, bringing an eerie silence with it, much like standing within a graveyard in the middle of the night.</p><p>Despite having been struck across the face hard enough to leave a trickle of blood running from her nose, Lorelei's expression was as placid and calm. She made no effort to redress any grievances she might be feeling. Instead, she fixed her posture before lowering her head slightly once again. Even if someone were to try and view her thoughts using Advanced Magecraft, they would find her mind to be in a serene and unperturbed state.</p><p>After staring at his granddaughter for several tense seconds, Lord Barthomeloi turned his eyes back to the front as he stated, "As a Barthomeloi, you do not lack the prestige to look down upon others. That woman, however, is not someone you can afford to look down on. Her bloodline is something even our family cannot compare to. You will fight her to the best of your abilities from the start. I did not come here to watch a show. I came here to prevent those two old monsters from doing anything to interfere with our family's matters."</p><p>Though this was his first time seeing Vahn directly, Lord Barthomeloi could already sense there was something 'inexplicable' about the man. Even with his eyes, he was unable to see through the depths of Vahn's power. He could tell that Vahn was weaker than he was but with the entourage he brought along, even Lord Barthomeloi couldn't act with impunity. He had never met Merlin but, after trying to see through the flowery Magus' depths, Lord Barthomeloi actually felt a backlash and, for a brief moment, he was certain the white-haired man had even smiled toward him.</p><p>As one of the most powerful existences on the Surface, Lord Barthomeloi's mind was like a fortress. The vast majority of Magi, regardless of how powerful they were, would not be able to breach his mental defenses but, as if they didn't exist at all, he was certain the man at the back of Vahn's group had peered into his mind. This made him feel threatened for the first time in more than two-hundred years thus, after hearing Lorelei's remark, he couldn't help but remind her to treat this matter with the severity it was due.</p><p>---</p><p>At the same time that Lord Bathomeloi was thinking of him, Merlin was rubbing his with the back of his sleeve after surprising the entire room with a loud sneeze. This reminded everyone that he was still present, including Zelretch. When the old man realized he had been ignoring Merlin this entire time, he was slightly taken aback before hardening his expression. The only way he would have been able to overlook Merlin's presence, especially after seeing him earlier, was if the flowery Magus was proactively obscuring his perception.</p><p>With a look of mock-embarrassment on his face, Merlin produced a wry smile as he stated in an airy tone, "Oh, pardon me. Spring allergies. Please, continue." This remark caused Artoria to sigh deeply while Vahn and Zelretch stared back at him with incredulous looks. There was no way someone that was literally known as the 'Magus of Flowers' would be affected by something like pollen. They were located in one of the most secure places within the entire Association, far beyond the means for any stray pollen to reach...</p><p>Deciding not to bother with Merlin, Vahn shook his head before turning to Zelretch and asking, "Is Solon not going to preside over this duel? I believe a 'senior' Magus needs to be present to ensure the duel's conditions are not breached. With Lorelei's status, the only person who can preside over this match should be Solon, correct?"</p><p>Instead of Zelretch answering, it was Merlin who issued a light chuckle before musing, "Little Solon is indisposed of at the moment. Don't worry, as someone rather special will be presiding over today's duel. I'm actually a little excited. Today is a day of many reunions~"</p><p>Even without Merlin going into greater detail, it was easy to intuit that he was already meeting with Solon in private. This caused Zelretch to grip his cane a little tighter as realization dawned on him as to why he had been unable to sense Merlin for the past few minutes. The Magus before him was just another illusion, albeit one that was almost indiscernible from an actual person. He was aware of the fact that Merlin had been imprisoned on the Reverse Side of the World so, seeing him able to freely move about despite being severely restricted, Zelretch couldn't help but feel like he was in the same room as a monster.</p><p>Merlin just laughed in response to the way Zelretch was looking at him. Then, with a playful wave of his hand, he began to fade away from the room without asking for permission to leave. He and Vahn had already discussed the meeting with Solon and, if not for their prior agreement, Merlin would not have revealed himself so early. There were far more dangerous existences in the world than anything the Mage's Association could throw at them so. Once it was known that he was present, there were a number of troublesome individuals who would immediately come seeking him...</p><p>Zelretch wanted to follow after Merlin but, with Vahn's temperament, he felt the need to be present to avoid any troublesome developments. With this in mind, he could only release a tired sigh as, for a brief moment, his age showed far more than it usually did. He kept calm by reminding himself that Merlin, despite his eccentricities, was not a dangerous person. Though Solon would probably have to 'suffer' for a bit, they wouldn't be too affected by the relatively short meeting.</p><p>In an effort to distract himself, Zelretch's eyes suddenly turned into a kaleidoscope of thousands of images as he was very curious about who would be arriving. This caught everyone's attention while Vahn, having witnessed something similar in the past, couldn't help but smile slightly. Zelretch's use of the Second Magic reminded him a lot of Ina's ability to view the future, albeit far more advanced. This was further proof that the most powerful abilities, regardless of their complexity, usually had an Innate that had similar functionality.</p><p>After a surprisingly short period of time, Zelretch's eyes returned to normal and, replacing the dour expression on his face, he now had a wolfish grin before spontaneously laughing. Then, adding to the incredulity of the situation, Zelretch suddenly stopped laughing before adopting a very serious expression as he explained, "It seems three Mages will be gathering here today. Please, Your Majesty, do not offend the person coming to preside over the match. She can be a very hotheaded individual and I fear the Association will not be able to survive a conflict between the two of you..."</p><p>Vahn looked at Zelretch like he was senile but, after processing his words, he answered, "We do not seek unnecessary conflict. Unless that woman antagonizes us, there is no reason for concern..." Even before he had finished his words, Vahn could see a dejected glimmer in Zelretch's eyes as he shook his head. There was a smile present on his face and, after a few tense moments, he just shrugged his shoulders and said, "Well, it's been a while since I had to go all out. Don't worry. I'm not planning on fighting against you. If I don't interfere, all of London might end up being destroyed in the process."</p><p>At this point, Vahn was getting annoyed by how Zelretch was obviously beating around the bush. At the same time, however, he was somewhat curious about what kind of opponent would require the elderly Magus to go all out. Based on Zelretch's words, it was obvious that the person he was talking about was a wielder of True Magic. After all, the only people that were allowed to call themselves by the title of 'Mage' were those who had either reached the Root, or inherited the Magic from their ancestors."</p><p>Surprising Zelretch quite a bit, Vahn adopted a smile on his face as he mused, "Aoko Aozaki, the Fifth Magician..." with a fair amount of intrigue. Alaya had taken it upon herself to inform him of who was on the way, even without him asking for the information.</p><p>Zelretch grimaced like someone who had their fun ruined but, rather than ask how Vahn obtained the information, he gave a curt nod before stating, "Indeed. It isn't an exaggeration to say that she is the most capable Magician in terms of destructive capabilities. Though she is still a little wet behind the ears, even I don't have the confidence in being about to outlast one of her tantrums. She is a good and honest lass, despite being a little temperamental..."</p><p>While Zelretch was giving his explanation, Alaya, seated snuggly on Vahn's shoulder, gave her own accounting of Aoko's character, stating, "That woman is irresponsible. Though her actions are a necessity in guaranteeing the current cycle comes to an end, her use of the Fifth Magic will cause the inevitable destruction of the Universe. If she uses it haphazardly, even Type: Mercury will not be able to defeat her. I would advise you to exercise caution, Master..."</p><p>Hearing Alaya's words, Vahn felt his scalp tingle as he couldn't even fathom how strong ORT was yet, according to his perpetual companion, she could even defeat an existence he had little, if any, hope of defeating. This was a jarring discovery as, while he knew the Administrative Functions were all very powerful, he hadn't expected such an information bomb at this point in time. He was actually a little annoyed as, until now, despite having discussed potential dangers several times, Aoko's name hadn't even been brought up.</p><p>The 'original' Aoko was actually one of his targets but, for the past two years or so, Vahn hadn't even thought about the Quest that had been assigned to him by Akasha. Now that he knew she had such an extreme amount of power, he suddenly felt the need to increase his own. At the same time, Vahn couldn't deny that he was actually interested in seeing just how strong such a person could be. Since Merlin and Alaya hadn't warned him about her, she likely wasn't a 'threat', despite having more than enough power to oppose them.</p><p>Recognizing the look in Vahn's eyes, Zelretch shook his head in exasperation as he said, "If you want to fight her, please do it elsewhere. I would hope that, as an Emperor, you have the wherewithal to avoid causing unnecessary collateral damage. I can help you arrange a battle if you'd like. Just don't do it here." The battle between Artoria and Lorelei was already pushing the limits of what the arena could withstand so, if two people capable of wielding True Magic began to fight, it was only a matter of time before everything was destroyed.</p><p>Despite Vahn having never stated it outright, Zelretch considered him a wielder of True Magic and, now that rumors had been circulating, others saw him in the same light. He imagined this was the primary reason behind Aoko's visit as, even after the revelation of Angra Mainyu's emergence, she hadn't particularly cared. She wasn't too fond of the current Association, despite the Aozaki family being one of its core affiliates.</p><p>Hearing Zelretch's words, Vahn dismissively waved his hand before saying, "Today is the opportunity for our Empress to display her prowess. I will only intervene if the Barthomeloi family tries anything shady. If Aoko is as you describe, I doubt we will come to blows. Rather, after this matter is settled, I would prefer to meet with her directly. I'm certain she would want to be present for the discussions so please inform Solon of her attendance. If she chooses to abstain, however, leave her be. It is only a matter of time before we sit down for a discussion as, with her power, I imagine she will have her own conditions to present to the Empire...hahahaha~"</p><p>Zelretch could only shake his head with a wry smile after hearing Vahn's words. He could only hope that Aoko was in a good mood as, with her nature, she was the most likely person to start the fight. As for Vahn's remark about Aoko's conditions, Zelretch was genuinely afraid that she would actually ally herself with the Empire in the future. If that were the case, the Empire would become the most powerful force in the entire world overnight. After all, while the Fifth Magic had various uses, the one it was most famous for was being able to draw out a person's future potential in the present...</p><p>With this in mind, Zelretch's gaze briefly flickered over Fenrir as, while she was one of the weakest in the procession, her potential terrified him. If she were to meet with Aoko on amicable terms, it was impossible to know exactly powerful she would become...</p><p>(A/N: Alternate Titles: '*Smack*','RIP Solon','The Fifth Magician is a little scary...?')</p><p>https://bit.ly/2XBzAYu &lt;-(p.atreon link)</p><p>paypal.me/Einlion</p><p>Discord Invite: https://discord.gg/mn5xMbE</p></main><div class="link-group"><a class="btn" href="01259.html">Previous</a><a class="btn" href="index.html">Table of Contents</a><a class="btn" href="01261.html">Next</a></div></div><div id="readpos">0%</div></body></html>
