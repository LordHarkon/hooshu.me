<p>With the door closing behind her, sealing her fate, Luvia showed no discernible hesitation as she licked her lips before asking, "My Emperor, to what do I owe the pleasure of this nightly visit~?" Despite the pretense in her words, Luvia began to peel off her elbow-length gloves, letting them fall to the floor unceremoniously as she meandered towards the bed, her hips swaying seductively. Since he knew she was a virgin, Vahn found Luvia's behavior rather amusing as, at this point, she should know his character well enough to understand the 'danger' involved with such temptation. However, based on how her mother had behaved, combined with the fact Luvia had been training hard her entire life, there was a good chance she had a preference towards a little bit of pain...</p><p>Though he still intended to treat her gently during her first time, Vahn was looking forward to his future interactions with Luvia as girls with strong personalities like hers were always interesting to spend time with. With that in mind, he had walked up behind Luvia, running his fingers through her meticulously styled hair, remarking, "My business this night is pleasure itself...will you join me, My Empress...?" As Rin had already made it clear she had no intention of being involved in politics at all, this left Luvia as the only 'candidate' to assume the title of his official Empress. Though he could keep the primary position empty, she would, at the very least, become one of Empress Consorts in the near future. Thus, though it was jumping the gun a bit, Vahn didn't mind playing along as the smell of Luvia's citrusy shampoo tickled his nose...</p><p>With Vahn standing right behind her, Luvia leaned her back against his chest, trusting that he wouldn't let her fall as she tilted her head up, her golden-brown eyes glimmering with expectant light. Then, in response to his words, Luvia snaked her hand between their two bodies, sneakily extending her fingers toward Vahn's belt as she huskily intoned, "It would be my pleasure..." Since her mother had taught her to always be 'direct' when it came to matters between men and women, Luvia was intending to be proactive instead of just leaving everything to Vahn. Thus, while trying to unfasten his belt, Luvia inclined her head at an awkward angle, attempting to steal Vahn's lips in an effort to further rile him up...</p><p>Vahn was rather fond of Luvia's aggressive and 'confident' manner, even though he could feel her heart beating furiously from where his chest met her back. This didn't mean he was going to let her steal the initiative, however, so, with dexterity that startled Luvia quite a bit, Vahn deftly loosened the buttons of her blouse, seemingly in a single swift motion. As a result, her blouse basically burst open, revealing her lacey white lingerie that, at a glance, met Vahn's expectation of what women referred to as 'battle underwear'. Luvia had clearly been anticipating this moment since their last parting as, more often than not, women would wear comfortable and fitted lingerie instead of flashier garments that were considerably less comfortable. This was especially the case when wearing 'fashionable' clothing as it was often tailored to be form-fitting, making comfortable undergarments almost a necessity to avoid pinching and chafing.</p><p>Since he knew she had worn it for him to admire, Vahn wasn't shy about tracing his fingers across the fabric while, distracted by what he was doing, Luvia had stopped kissing him to watch Vahn's hands dance across her brassier and breasts. At the same time, his right hand was loosening the band around her waist, causing the fabric of her dress to slowly loosen until, just as Vahn's hand slipped under her brassier, it fell to the ground around her ankles. As she was wearing matching lace lingerie underneath, Vahn was able to confirm his suspicions, causing him to stifle a chuckle as he gently blew into Luvia's ear, startling her in the process.</p><p>Brought back to her senses by Vahn's hot breath, Luvia grabbed his left wrist in a vain attempt to prevent him from moving around too much, smiling as she mused, "You are rather skilled with your hands...nnn~!" Toward the end of her words, Vahn gently pinched Luvia's already rigid nipple while, using the moment when she was distracted, his right hand came to rest on her lower abdomen. By the time she felt the heat of his palm, Vahn was already tracing up the visible dividing line of her muscles which, when she exhaled sharply, allowed the outline of a six-pack to be seen. Instead of detracting from her physical appeal, Luvia's shapely figure and soft skin created a rare blend of beauty and practicality...</p><p>Realizing the dire straits she was in, Luvia leaned her body forward in an attempt to escape Vahn's grasp and move to the bed. This caused her butt to briefly touch against something hard, sending an instinctual shiver up her spine as Vahn's hands tightened into an embrace around her body. Now, they were even closer together and, before she even realized when it happened, Luvia noticed that her blouse had outright 'vanished' into thin air. Vahn was also bare-chested, allowing her to feel his body heat through her back as his hands dancing around her body, pushing 'buttons' she didn't even know existed. This caused Luvia's body to gradually heat up as, in a last-ditch attempt to keep some semblance of control over the situation, she perked up her butt, releasing a hot laugh as she mused, "There is something poking my butt..."</p><p>Vahn nodded his head in response, bringing his left hand to gently stroke her neck and jaw as he remarked, "I can't help it...you have an amazing body, Luvia. Your butt and breasts are both firm yet soft...I feel incredibly fortunate right now..." As he spoke, Vahn gently pressed against Luvia's lower abdomen while lightly moving his hips, enjoying the feeling of her well-developed posterior while resisting the urge to immediately move on to the next phase of things. This was made even more difficult when, even though he knew she shouldn't be feeling it 'that' much, Luvia began to make agonizingly seductive moans in response to his movements. It seemed she had given up on trying to take the lead and, though it was unnecessary, she seemed to be pandering to his ego...</p><p>Though he appreciated the sentiment, Vahn was mildly taken aback by Luvia's actions, even though he also knew she was likely just trying to rile him up further. She was trying to egg him on, either in an attempt to get him to treat her more roughly or perhaps as a means to preserve her own pride. Either way, it ultimately didn't matter all that much as, from the very beginning, Vahn didn't intend to 'hold back' all that much. Luvia couldn't hide her reactions from him so, by matching her natural bio-rhythm and using skills he had polished over hundreds of sexual conquests, it wasn't long before her reactions became much more genuine...</p><p>Instead of leaning against his body, Luvia was leaning forward slightly, relying on Vahn's support to avoid falling over as his right hand had already breached the line of defense provided by her lacey lingerie. Though she was well-groomed, Luvia had a neat patch of hair on her mons pubis which, as Vahn's fingers dexterously navigated her vulva, tickled his wrist and palm. At the same time, Luvia was releasing gasping moans as he firmly gripped her right breast, holding her body up as he simultaneously pressed the sizeable bulge in his trousers against the fabric of her panties. The white fabric had already become transparent from her own fluids and, though it was a rather precarious-looking sight, the front of Vahn's trousers had become several shades darker from absorbing the moisture from her lower body.</p><p>In normal circumstances, Vahn would spend more time preparing the women he was with, especially if it was their first time, but Luvia wasn't a normal woman. He knew it would be more meaningful for her if he took more 'proactive' measures, rather than just playing with her body and leading her to climax with his fingers. With that in mind, Vahn had sneakily dulled the pain receptors in Luvia's lower body while also linking together her nerve clusters in a way that, when she climaxed, it would be on the more 'extreme' side. Then, just as she was reaching the peak of her building pleasure, to the point she was biting down hard on her lip in vain resistance, Vahn caused Luvia's eyes to turn as round as saucers, placing her soaked panties into his Inventory while unequipping his trousers.</p><p>Faster than she could process what was happening, Vahn placed his glans gainst Luvia's entrance, having already understood its location and structure during his earlier exploration. Then, in one swift motion, while hugging Luvia's body tightly against his, Vahn jerked his hips forward with enough momentum to cause her legs to momentarily give out as a result of the simultaneous pain and pleasure that caused her mind to completely blank out. Her mouth opened and closed like a fish, as if she were attempting to scream, but the only thing escaping her throat for a few seconds was a choked gasp as her diaphragm had tensed up while her back attempted to curl in his embrace...</p><p>Using his right hand to ease the tensions of her body, by rubbing up and down her abdomen, Vahn slowly brought Luvia back to her senses. She ultimately didn't release any loud screams or moans and instead just shook in his embrace as her body was wracked in pleasure. At the same time, she could feel a throbbing sensation from her lower body that matched her own heartbeat, pain and pleasure intermixed like the viscous fluid and blood dripping down her thighs. This wasn't outside her expectations, though Vahn's actions certainly had been...what bothered Luvia the most was, even though she couldn't see where they were connected properly, she knew there was a 'gap' between her body and Vahn's. Though she knew he was supposed to be on the larger side, it still bothered her a little that he had already reached her deepest parts with size to spare...</p><p>After regulating her breathing to the point of regaining her ability to speak, Luvia lightly rubbed her own abdomen while complaining, "I didn't expect my first time...to be standing in the middle of a room...do you like it...like this...?" In response to her words, Vahn just continued to hold Luvia's body in his embrace, answering, "I got the impression you wanted to experience something more intense than normal for your first time. If we used the bed normally, it would be hard to avoid feeling as if you're in a submissive position. When we're done here, I'll take you over to the coach and have you straddle my hips on your own...after that, I'll help wash your body and then you can enjoy sleeping in your bed without having to clean the bedding..."</p><p>Hearing Vahn's explanation, Luvia began to laugh in a sonorous, albeit intermittent, manner before she released a hot sigh and remarked, "My grandmother and mother taught me that the women in our family can only get excited when our partner is both stronger than us and greedily seeking our bodies...I feel like this kind of limitation doesn't really apply to you...even though I am more than a little excited...ufufufu~." Toward the end of her words, though it caused her a twinge of pain and pleasure, Luvia tightly squeezed her buttcheeks while flexing her lower abdominal muscles. The pain did actually make her feel more excited, almost as if she were in the midst of a hard-fought battle...</p><p>Taking Luvia's words and movement as permission, Vahn moved his right hand to tease Luvia's tiny nerve cluster while circling his hips in a deep pistoning motion. Unlike her pretend moans, Luvia was the type of woman that seemed to feel it quite yet, instead of crying out, she just released hot and slightly pained breaths as her brows deeply furrowed. She matched her breathing to his movements, something that greatly enhanced her experience as breathing in tune to your body's natural rhythm could greatly increase focus and awareness. This was something most women only picked up after being 'guided' properly but, as she had spent most of her life fighting and training, Luvia had keyed in on this simple yet effective technique by pure instinct...</p><p>After a few minutes of gentle and targetted movements, Luvia's body tensed up once again, causing her to step on her tiptoes as Vahn prevented her from falling over. At the same time, warm liquid flowing from her body, further lubricating Vahn's member and causing a cool feeling on his thighs after the initial warmth faded. This was Luvia's second big climax but, unlike her first one, Luvia had adapted quite a bit since then, using one arm to cling to Vahn's head while taking in deep breaths and releasing hot sighs. She didn't cry out or anything, indicating to Vahn that her 'threshold' was higher than normal women, useful information if he intended to push her to the 'peak'.</p><p>Since he knew it wouldn't be long before Luvia complained about him not 'finishing', Vahn waited until she was coming down from her high before musing, "Now I'll have you make me feel good..." With that said, Vahn guided the confused Luvia's body, bending her forward until she was basically touching her toes. She could easily place her palms against the ground while Vahn kept a firm hold of her hips, gently thrusting into her as he explained, "This is usually a little too advanced for most people at the start but I feel like you will be able to enjoy this quite a bit...from this position, blood will rush to the head and, by the time you climax a third time, even you might not be able to stay silent..."</p><p>Though Luvia looked like she wanted to say something, it was actually rather difficult to talk from such a position, especially when Vahn's began to smack against her butt with a bit of force. It felt like there was a wave running from her lower body to her head, causing Luvia to tense up and hold her breath every time he moved. She could have avoided this situation by avoiding the position entirely but, now that she was already bent forward, Luvia could only support herself by pressing against the ground as her heavy breasts bounced with Vahn's movements, making it even harder to breathe...</p><p>This had been one of Anubis' favorite positions and, as Lakshmibai had also been rather fond of it, Vahn felt that Luvia would also get a kick out of it. She wasn't in any danger of actually suffocating but, feeling that you 'might' suffocate could activate the body's natural preservation instincts which also included the instinct to breed. Though it was subtle, he could feel her body heating up as her brain began to light up like fireworks with each of his movements. Since staying like this for too long could actually be dangerous, however, Vahn began to gradually speed up as he enjoyed the guilty pleasure of watching ripples travel through Luvia's plump butt. Then, as he was nearly his own completion, Luvia began to groan a bit before releasing a subdued moan through clenched teeth, her face turning beet red as a haze of moisture began to build up in her eyes.</p><p>As Luvia's body began to convulse, causing her inside to writhe pleasantly around his member, Vahn used a combination of lifting her with his left hand and telekinesis to bring Luvia upright as he slammed against her hips one last time. Then, as warm liquid filled her insides, a rush of fresh oxygen reached Luvia's brain that caused her legs to shake and quiver as, for a brief moment, she outright passed out in his arms. This was only for around two seconds, however, causing Luvia to release a long and sensuous moan as she came back to awareness and continued to tremble in his arms with her eyes closed. She even hugged her own body by instinct, making no effort to resist as she let the pleasure wash over her and entrusted her everything to Vahn's care...</p><p>---</p><p>When Luvia finally came back to her senses, she spent several seconds in silence, looking at where she and Vahn were connected as milky white fluid dripped down her thighs and covered most of his member. This caused her to remember something her grandmother had taught her, allowing her to break free from the almost existential crisis she was experiencing. She moved to step away from Vahn, this time with the latter allowing her to escape without interference. Though she was feeling weak in the knees, Luvia was able to stand without assistance as she released a hot and heavy sigh after having successfully escaped. There was a lingering heat in her lower body but, in order to at least contribute 'something' to this situation, Luvia managed her best seductive grin as she mused, "Let me clean you up..."</p><p>Hearing her words, Vahn was tempted to point out that such things weren't necessary but, as Luvia seemed intent on carrying out her service, he ultimately just squinted his eyes with an appreciative smile on his face. He was somewhat looking forward to Luvia's realization that she was no longer able to stand after sitting down but, as such experience were part of what made moments like this 'special', he remained silent as she sat in a seiza-like position and began licking around his thighs and penis, lapping up the love juices and semen without showing any signs it bothered her. When she got to his member, she even looked up at him, establishing eye contact and gauging his reaction like someone far more experienced than she was...</p><p>Though Luvia made no attempt to take his full length, she did suckle on his glans in an attempt to suck out any semen that had been left in his urethra. As there was nothing, however, she finished things off by giving his glans a long kiss before flicking the very tip with her tongue and saying, "All finished~." in a cheerful yet seductive tone. Then, after trying to rise to her feet, Luvia realized she was stuck seated on the floor but, instead of laughing at her, Vahn politely extended his hand with a casual smile on his face. She gained a slight blush in response but still grabbed his hand, musing, "My, what a gentleman..." while rising unsteadily to her feet. When her legs were stretched out once again, Luvia was able to exert a bit more strength into them, allowing Vahn to guide her over to the sofa before sitting down.</p><p>Remembering what Vahn had said earlier, Luvia took a deep breath to steady her heart as she climbed atop his lap, using his assistance since her legs were still shaky. Now that they were facing each other, Luvia felt calmer than before, especially since she was the one on top. Though she had felt great earlier, it had been a frightening amount of pleasure that, even now, Luvia hadn't fully recovered from. Like this, she would be able to control the pace and, as this seemed to be Vahn's intention as well, Luvia didn't waste any time as she ran her hand across his cheek and began kissing him rather passionately. At the same time, she raised her hips slightly, guiding Vahn's member with her right hand as she inexperiencedly tried to find the right angle. Fortunately, he had his hands placed on her butt, guiding her hips so that she didn't have to fumble around and embarrass herself for too long...</p><p>Then, after separating from Vahn's lips for a short moment, Luvia bit her own as she slowly rocked her hips and allowed Vahn to sink into her steamy cavern. Any pain that had been present had long faded and, as her body was still awash in the echoes of her earlier climax, Luvia felt a few waves pass through her body as his hot glans pried her apart before knocking at the entrance of her cervix. She noticed that her vision would flicker momentarily whenever he contacted her deepest part, a trait she would later learn was rather rare. Most women, at least when they weren't ovulating, would feel a suffocating discomfort whenever their cervix was pressured. There were very few women who were 'sensitive' in that specific area, indicating that Luvia's body was extremely suited for rearing children...</p><p>Vahn hadn't been able to see Luvia's face easily previously but, seeing the twinge of her eyes as she experimentally moved her hips, he had keyed in on this peculiarity almost instantly. Though it was a little too early for her, Vahn felt that Luvia would become fond of doing it from behind in the future. Standing didn't give the best angle but, when the moved the activity to the bed, Vahn would be able to use a technique that Freya had taught him in the past. It didn't work against most girls but, for those like Luvia, there was a way to 'condition' their body to greatly increase sensitivity.</p><p>Freya called this technique 'lockpicking' as it involved gently pressing the glans against the cervix over and over in a steady yet slow rhythm that provided little to no stimulus to the rest of the vagina. This would be an unbearable experience for most women but, for those that were sensitive at the entrance to their womb, it would cause them to gradually become more sensitive as their whole vagina began to writhe in response to even gentle prodding. According to her, those that experienced such pleasure would never be able to leave the person who had used the technique against them. It was for this reason that she had named it 'lockpicking' as, if it was done correctly, you would have effectively opened up the woman's heart completely.</p><p>Though he would have to get Luvia's permission first, as it wasn't something you simply 'recovered' from after the fact, there was a chance their sex in the future would become even more amazing. He could still remember how girls like Freya, Hestia, and Lefiya had reacted to his 'lockpicking', bringing a smile to Vahn's face when he saw Luvia twitch after 'accidentally' kissing the tip of his glans with her cervix...</p><p>(A/N: Alternate Titles: 'If a woman is wearing matching underwear, they are either very picky or intended to be seen (UwU)...','Vahn is a bully...','RIP Luvia xD...')</p><p>https://bit.ly/2XBzAYu &lt;-(p.atreon link)</p><p>paypal.me/Einlion</p><p>Discord Invite: https://discord.gg/mn5xMbE</p></main><div class="link-group"><a class="btn" href="01168.html">Previous</a><a class="btn" href="../index.html">Table of Contents</a><a class="btn" href="01170.html">Next</a></div></div><div id="readpos">0%</div></body></html>
