<p>Several hours after his battle against Tiona, just as the day had begun to transition into the afternoon, Vahn finally emerged from one of the few actual rooms within the Coliseum after removing the barrier he had erected. He was wearing nothing but a pair of brown shorts and because he had grown a bit weary of wandering eyes, a set of wolf furs around his waist like a pareo. Though he had exerted himself quite a bit over the last few hours, Vahn felt extremely refreshed and had a gratified smile on his face as Tiona and Tione unsteadily made their way out of the room behind him. Both girls affectionately clung to his body and, even though he had already tended to them plentily, it was never that easy to quell the fires within an Amazoness' body.</p><p>If not for the 'guests' that had been lingering outside of his barrier for quite a while, Vahn would likely have spent the entire day alongside the two passionate Amazonesses, especially since it had been quite a while since they were together. This was a sentiment shared by both Tiona and Tione so, even though they were practically glowing as a result of Vahn's affection, each had a dull and slightly annoyed expression as they looked towards the two who had interrupted their quality time with Vahn.</p><p>The smaller of the two was, as could be expected, Kali; Her blood-red eyes were equally as dull while staring back at the three people who had decided to have a mid-morning tryst. Standing next to her, with a curious yet fierce expression, was a tall woman with similarly brown skin to most Amazonesses. She was around 171cm tall and, as a result of wearing very little clothing, her mature and shapely figure was on full display. Vahn's eyes had been drawn to her peculiar dark-brown hair since it was allowed to grow wildly, much like Tiona's in her [Pactio] form, and had frosted white tips at the end of individual tufts that clumped together to give it a spikey appearance. Her eyes were a reddish-yellow, similar to a jaguar's, and had an angular curve that gave her a perpetually fierce expression, even when she was relaxed.</p><p>Seeing herself scrutinized by the interesting boy before her, the woman's smile curled up at the edges of her lips as she straightened out her back and puffed out her rather developed chest. Kali had been 'glaring' at Tiona and Tione but, sensing the movement of her companion, looked to the side before raising up her hand in a swift motion. Immediately thereafter, a very loud and resonating 'smack' was heard as Kali slapped her hand across the nearly exposed bottom of the more mature goddess and exclaimed, "You supposed to be some kind of proud hen!? If you want to play, I'm sure you can find a few men that have been collected by your brats, can't you!? This one is mine...!"</p><p>Rubbing the quickly swelling handprint on her backside, the mature-looking goddess made a pitiful expression with slight tears in her eyes as she complained, "Kali, you're a big bully...! You always keep the-" Before she was able to finish, the goddess went silent as Kali's expression turned especially fierce, seemingly 'daring' her to finish her sentence. Thus, after swallowing an audible gulp, the goddess immediately backed down before looking towards Vahn, Tiona, and Tione. She chose to focus on the latter two, showing a slightly pained smile as she said, "It's been a long time. The two of you have grown up a great deal in the last...few years...?"</p><p>With her words trailing off, the goddess eyed Tiona and Tione up and down before giving an awkward smile and falling silent. Kali had noticed this as well, allowing a deep frown to mar her face before she looked toward Tiona and Tione with a scrutinizing gaze. Before things could get any more awkward, Vahn had reached his hands around both girls, holding them closely as he said, "Soon enough, I'll have to make good on my promises in order to facilitate a smooth transition in the future. Tiona and Tione will be the ones to help pave the way forward and I've already made them both wait far longer than they should have..."</p><p>This time, Kali's frown deepened to the extreme but, after a few seconds had passed, she simply released a heavy sigh and said, "Whatever...anyways, this dairy cow goddess is Banka-Mundi. She was lingering around even after waiting for a few hours so I decided to see what she wanted. Go ahead and say what you need to say and then get the hell out of my Coliseum..." Kali had turned away for the last few words, forming a purple sash with her Divinity that hugged her arms and waist as she made her way towards an adjacent corridor. She was obviously annoyed by how things had turned out and, unable to 'deal' with it directly, decided to just go do something else instead of worrying about the affairs of others...</p><p>With the departure of Kali, Banka-Mundi visible relaxed before training her jaguar-like eyes on Tiona and Tione, smiling as she said, "Congratulations, you two. I'm certain your daughters will be exceptional Amazonesses..." Having a Divinity related to Fertility, it hadn't taken much time for Banka-Mundi to confirm the swirling mass of vitality within the bodies of both girls. Unless they took medicine to prevent it, the chance of them bearing a child was exceedingly close to 100%...</p><p>Though Vahn had been intending to wait until they returned to the Manor, he had gotten a bit caught up in the momentum of things after carrying Tiona's quickly recovering body away from the arena. With her energy returning, her body had started to burn up quite severely and, even though she had only watched the fight, it was obvious that Tione was also riled up quite a bit. As a result, Vahn had cordoned off one of the lesser traveled areas of the Coliseum and spent a few hours quenching the fires in both girls' bodies. When they were getting dressed after the fact, Vahn had seen the longing looks in their eyes and mentioned allowing nature to take its course, leading to the scene of both girls practically fawning over him as they clung affectionately to his body...</p><p>Tiona began to laugh sheepishly while hugging Vahn's arm even tighter as Tione averted her eyes with a light blush on her cheeks. Neither really knew what to feel at this moment other than sheer happiness since, for the first time since they had met Vahn, their instincts had been fully pacified. They both felt a profound feeling of 'completion' that was hard to describe and, at least for the time being, the only thing they really cared about was being around Vahn and protecting the yet-to-exist life within their bodies. It would take several days before anything was confirmed but, unless something unexpected happened, the odds were heavily in their favor...</p><p>Since he would also rather just spend some time with Tiona and Tione, Vahn gave a polite smile to Banka-Mundi, asking, "Is there something I can help you with...?" This brought the goddess' focus back to him as her gaze lingered over his body for a few moments before she finally responded, saying, "I was simply curious about what kind of man would have been allowed within the heart of Telskyura. Given Kali's behavior, I can tell you aren't simply a prize she had collected for herself...honestly, now I'm feeling a little envious. I've heard the rumors about you from those who pass through the jungle..."</p><p>Instead of Vahn speaking out, it was Tione who raised her head, a small frown adorning her face as she exclaimed, "Stop having selfish expectations for Vahn! He is already dealing with enough problems without every goddess he meets trying to pester him. If you want a baby so badly, why don't you just go fall in love with a different man and then ask for assistance...!?" Though she didn't care that much previously, now Tione felt extremely annoyed by anyone outside of the Manor trying to approach Vahn. Even Tiona had stopped laughing and was now looking at Banka-Mundi with her brows slightly furrowed.</p><p>In most cases, Banka-Mundi would have never allowed an Amazoness to talk to her in the way that Tione had just spoken. Since Kali had warned her beforehand, however, she tolerated the slight against herself and simply released a tired sigh before tracing her eyes over Vahn once again. This time, Vahn's expression was the one to turn slightly serious as he said, "Sorry, but if Tiona and Tione aren't okay with it, I'll have to refuse outright. If you do find someone you love in the future, please seek me out in Orario and I will help you find your own happiness..." Though Banka-Mundi was an exceptionally beautiful and shapely goddess, Vahn knew that she wouldn't really be able to leave Telskyura in the future and things were already complicated enough with Kali...</p><p>With Vahn making his own stance apparent, Banka-Mundi showed an expression of extreme regret as she mumbled, "That damned midget...this is unfair..." Her voice had been very quiet but it was easily picked up by Vahn, Tiona, and Tione, causing the mature goddess to pale slightly as she exclaimed, "Don't tell Kali I said that...!" Then, amidst an extremely awkward atmosphere, Banka-Mundi turned tail and exited the area with surprising agility. Vahn's eyes, for a very brief moment, had wandered towards her nearly exposed rump, earning him a light jab from Tione's elbow as she gave him a blaming look with her dull brown eyes...</p><p>Vahn produced a wry and apologetic smile and withheld the comment that nearly escaped his mouth before letting his hand trace down the line of Tione's body, resting his palm firmly on her own shapely backside. This caused Tione to raise her chin slightly, an approving smile spreading across her face as she said, "Just you wait, Vahn...one day, I will become a goddess myself. You shouldn't keep looking at other women all the time, even if you are just admiring their beauty. There are a lot of us who rely on you already and, until we're able to stand on the same level as you, please don't run too far ahead..." Since she truly believed in Vahn's words about mortals being able to ascend to godhood, Tione decided to make that her goal so that she could continue to stand at Vahn's side far into the future...</p><p>From the side, still clinging to Vahn's arm, Tiona began to issue a playful laugh, adding, "I think I'll become a Goddess of the Wild! Maybe I'll be able to transform like Lili and Fenrir in the future, then we can do all kinds of fun things together~." As these words left her lips, Tiona's eyes began to glitter with stars as a curious expression spread across her face. She tilted her head to the side in thought, asking, "I wonder...if I transformed into an animal and gave birth, would the babies be animals as well...?" Though it was a rather 'harmless' question, Tione's expression darkened while Vahn became uncharacteristically pale. If he had to be honest, he had thought about similar things in the past but it was a very different thing hearing someone else talk about it openly...</p><p>After giving her sister a look as if she had just said the most ridiculous thing in the world, Tione decided to lead the conversation back on track, stating, "I'd like to think I could become a Goddess of War but I don't think things would go well with people like you, Ais, and Haruhime around. Maybe I should focus more on my Innates and [Pactio] so I can become a Goddess of the Sun, Moon, or maybe Beauty...?" The last Divinity Tione had listed caused her to produce a very thoughtful expression on her face before she turned to Vahn and asked, "You'll help me, right...?"</p><p>Vahn immediately nodded his head, a natural smile on his face as he confidently stated, "I cannot elevate you to godhood through my own but I can still help you reach the peak through your own efforts. Just make sure you're talking with the goddesses in the Manor before you decide that is the type of future you want for yourself. I'll be able to do something about the compulsion of Divinity at some point but eternal life isn't such an easy thing to tolerate with-" Tione had brought her hand up, placing it over Vahn's mouth as she said, "Just say yes, you idiot..."</p><p>Tione's action had caused a peculiar atmosphere to descend upon the three lovers for a short while before they all began laughing uninhibitedly. Vahn did have a tendency to overthink and overexplain things, even though a simple answer was often best. Thus, after laughing his heart out for a while, Vahn hugged both girls firmly in his embrace before saying, "Yes...I will always be there for both of you. I'll be there for our daughters as well...always and forever..." In response, Tiona and Tione had hugged Vahn with a bit too much strength as the latter said, "That's a little better..." before stealing a kiss. This caused Tiona to produce a pretend pout before immediately stealing one of her own after their lips had separated...</p><p>---</p><p>Before things could get too out of hand, Vahn had eventually separated from Tiona and Tione after enjoying a long lunch together. Tiona had wanted to check on the status of Bache and, with nothing better to do, Tione decided to tag along with her. As for Vahn, he had made his way towards Kali's chamber, finding the diminutive goddess laying on her side as she absentmindedly watched two oiled-up younglings wrestle about next to the first. They had stopped their actions when Vahn entered, causing Kali to train her blood-red eyes on him, a small frown on her face as she asked, "Oh, now that you've played around on your own, you've decided to 'grace' this goddess with your presence...?"</p><p>Kali had waved her hand to dismiss the two younglings, earning worried and distraught looks from the two girls as they quickly scampered out of the chamber. The older of the two girls gave Vahn a resentful look as she ran by him, essentially blaming him for interrupting since she might not be able to get her Status Board updated. There was a long queue to be able to enter Kali's chambers and, unless she had taken an interest in you, it could be months before your turn would come up again. This was why so many of the younglings, other than when they were fighting in the arena, would spend hours practicing their dance moves and flexibility, all so that they could appeal to their goddess and increase their strength faster than their peers...</p><p>Vahn's expression hadn't changed under the glare of the young girl as he continued to stare into Kali's eyes, confidently stating, "I love them...that is the simple truth of the matter." This caused Kali to snort in response as she waved her hand dismissively once again, obviously intending for Vahn to leave the room. Since he didn't immediately move, Kali's frown deepened before she glared back at him and said, "Just leave, Vahn Mason...this place was never somewhere you should have ventured. Don't worry, I'll keep my promise and work to change things according to my agreement with Loki and Freya. It will take some time and the longer you're here, the more difficult it will be for me to do my own duties...!"</p><p>Kali wasn't sure of the reason herself, but she felt extremely angry just seeing Vahn right now. Even though she didn't mean what she was saying, Kali still let the words leave her lips as a sour feeling spread through her nose. She closed her eyes and snorted once again before rolling over and showing her back to Vahn, refusing to look at him any longer. There was a small amount of moisture building on her eyes, causing Kali to feel even more frustrated as her breathing began to accelerate. The only thing she truly knew right now was that she wanted Vahn to leave her alone, even though she also wanted him to comfort her again...it was a very confusing feeling and Kali didn't like it one bit...</p><p>(A/N: Alternate Titles: 'Vahn is a proficient firefighter','Since Vahn's Source Energy essentially enhances the genes of the girls, does that mean it almost guarantees that Tiona and Tione would give birth to twins...?','I can't stop this feeling...deep inside of me...boy you just don't realize what you do to me...')(A/N: Kali doesn't know how to love...)</p><p>https://bit.ly/2XBzAYu &lt;-(p.atreon link)</p><p>paypal.me/Einlion</p><p>Discord Invite: https://discord.gg/mn5xMbE</p></main><div class="link-group"><a class="btn" href="00953.html">Previous</a><a class="btn" href="../index.html">Table of Contents</a><a class="btn" href="00955.html">Next</a></div></div><div id="readpos">0%</div></body></html>
