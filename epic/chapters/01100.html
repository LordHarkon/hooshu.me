<p>After changing location to Vahn's room within the lakeside residence, the atmosphere had become even tenser than it had been outside. Though she didn't know the function of every formation within the room, Gray's intuition made her feel extremely nervous when Vahn activated the soundproofing function. As for Artoria, she 'seemed' surprisingly calm about the whole thing as this was neither her first time with Vahn nor her first experience with another woman. Out of consideration for Gray, she was putting on a strong front even though, more than ever before, Artoria was also feeling rather nervous due to the 'expectations' she had about what was to come. Vahn had treated her extremely gently last time and, though it had been well over a day since then, Artoria could still feel the 'echo' of their time together stirring within her heart...</p><p>To try and ease Gray's nervousness, and provide a distraction to herself, Artoria gingerly placed her hand on the former's shoulder before whispering, "You do not need to be afraid. Vahn understands how to treat women...just entrust yourself to him and this will be a memorable experience that you can fondly look back on..." Intending these words for herself just as much as they were meant for Gray, Artoria was trying to psyche herself up. She actually didn't want to be on the 'receiving' end of Vahn's affection too much as, if things continued as they had been, Artoria wasn't confident she would be able to maintain her dignity around him in the future. Even if this was exactly what Merlin meant by experiencing the happiness unique to women, Artoria felt she was changing faster than she could readily adapt to...</p><p>Hearing Artoria endorse him, Vahn allowed a smile to spread across his face as he took her words to heart, fully intending to give her an even 'more' memorable experience than before. Before that, he needed to make sure Gray was in the proper mindset as, even with Artoria at her side, she seemed like she might bolt for the door at a pin drop. He knew she would calm down a lot once they began so, after setting everything up, Vahn decided to take the lead this time around. Though Artoria had probably intended to 'play' in an effort to excite him, just as she and Fenrir had done previously, this wouldn't end well with someone like Gray. Such things might be possible after she was in the proper mood, but that would depend on his efforts, not Artoria's...</p><p>Though she looked like she wanted to retreat, Gray stood her ground as Vahn slowly closed the distance, her body shrinking slightly as her legs shivered like a newborn fawn. Knowing she would only struggle even more if he delayed things, Vahn stopped a few centimeters outside of Gray's personal space, adopting the most gentle smile he could manage as he slowly extended his hand out and said, "I swear...I will not hurt you, Gray..." Then, at a speed she could easily evade if she chose to, Vahn slowly extended his hand until his fingers came into contact with her cheek. Following this, Vahn moved his palm across her soft and tender skin, gently stroking her face and running his fingers through her hair...</p><p>On first contact, Gray had flinched in response to his touch but, after allowing him to begin caressing her face, she began to noticeably relax. This was one of the greatest benefits of his Petting Laws as his intent was easily able to reach the recipient, allowing them to understand he simply wanted to bring them comfort. Even Sc√°thach wasn't able to emulate this as, unlike Vahn, there was no sincerity within her actions. Because of this, he would always be far more proficient than she was, even if their basic comprehension was comparable. There were some things that relied more on experience and the emotions involved in the act, not the efficacy in which it was executed...</p><p>Artoria felt a little giddy watching Vahn suddenly caressing Gray's face and neck but, after thinking about it from a more rational standpoint, she could understand his intentions. As a result, she moved to the side and began the process of slowly undressing, understanding that Vahn was still observing her, even if he was focused on Gray. It made her feel strangely 'secure' knowing that Gray would be going first, giving her time to prepare herself as her body slowly heated up. By the time Artoria was preparing to remove her white panties, complete with lapis lazuli colored strings, she noticed her body was actually a little more than ready. Deciding it was best to leave them as they were, even though it made her body heat up much faster, Artoria sat on the edge of the bed and watched the scene play out between Vahn and Gray...</p><p>Since Gray had her eyes closed shut, Vahn had watched Artoria undress out of the corner of his eye, matching gazes with her several times throughout the process. The fact she was coordinating with him so easily brought a smile to Vahn's face as it was only a day ago that Fenrir had needed to lead Artoria along. He didn't know if she was simply a fast learner, or if that initial incident was all it took to shore up her mental resistance against these kinds of situations. As it ultimately didn't matter, Vahn invested most of his focus on Gray, now using two hands to gently massage her face and neck as it steadily gained a natural blush that permeated through her skin.</p><p>Though she had removed her hood, Gray was still wearing her fur-collared mantle, complete with a dual-layered cloak that was covered in silvery-gray runes. The one thing that had changed since she arrived at the Tohsaka Manor was that, at some point, Gray had slipped off her black windbreaker, revealing a thin, sleeveless, black blouse underneath. He could tell the synthetic fibers were actually made of very high-quality materials, even if he couldn't identify what they were at a glance. What he was able to determine was that they should be fire-resistant and, though it was likely negligible, provided enhanced magical resistance. Most importantly, at least for this situation, was that the blouse accented Gray's lithe figure well since it hugged her body like a second skin...</p><p>Through the gap in her mantle, Vahn was able to see two little beads poking the fabric of Gray's blouse, seemingly without her notice as she continued to enjoy his caress. Since he had already gotten to the point that he was running his fingers through the hair on the back of her head, Vahn felt like it was a good time to move things to the next level. Moving his fingers slowly along Gray's neck, Vahn brought his index fingers and thumbs to the small bow-knot that kept her mantle snugly around her shoulders. Gray opened her eyes in response to the sudden decrease in stimulus, staring with slightly hazy blue eyes as Vahn slowly pulled apart the strings of her bow. When the ribbons separated, she felt her mantle slack a bit as Vahn snaked his hands across her neck and collarbone before running them along her shoulders. This caused her mantle to drop heavily to the ground, a few metallic sounds and a muffled grunt sounding out from the cage she kept Add secured in...</p><p>With Gray only wearing a thin blouse, a pleated skirt, black stockings, and black gloves on both her hands, Vahn felt her appeal had jumped up a few notches in an instant. Seeing her bare shoulders and arms gave her a strange sense of 'balance' with the long black stockings running up to the midway point of her thighs. He felt like the only thing that could have improved her appearance in this state was if she were wearing form-hugging shorts to further add to her athletic and slightly boyish look. Though it might be inappropriate to refer to some girls in such a way, Vahn found this quality of Gray's to only increase her charm as his hands continued to massage around her neck and shoulders...</p><p>Seeing the appreciation and care in Vahn's expression as he steadily removed the tensions from her body, Gray found herself feeling far more relaxed than before. At the same time, however, this was far different than any of her previous experiences with men. Though she only had a few partners over the years, they always had a greedy and possessive look in their eyes from the start. They would almost always try and force her to kiss them as they selfishly did whatever they wanted. There was even one person who tried to get her to call him 'Daddy', something that had gotten the man put into the hospital since that particular subject was a landmine to her. As far as Gray knew, she didn't have a father so having some greedy idiot trying to force her to address him in such a way touched a sensitive nerve she hadn't even been aware of...</p><p>Feeling as if things were a little too strange, Gray brought her hands to Vahn's, something that immediately caused him to stop moving. This was also something that would have never worked on most men, causing Gray to feel that Vahn was far more considerate than 'normal'. With somewhat hastened breaths causing her words to carry a bit of warmth, Gray somewhat sheepishly asked, "You don't want me...to use my mouth...?" With her limited knowledge, Gray believed it was normal to lead up to sex by taking turns servicing each other. Though she hated the process, it was a simple fact that it made what followed 'easier' to tolerate...</p><p>Though he was more than a little surprised by the offer, Vahn felt more annoyed than anything since he could tell that Gray didn't even want to do what she was suggesting. Someone must have taught her something unnecessary, likely to service their own selfish desires, so Vahn was even more determined to make sure she left feeling completely satisfied. This would also serve to 'guarantee' that Gray wouldn't end up spilling his secrets in a moment of weakness. The stronger her feelings became, the less likely she was to even humor such thoughts as, with perhaps the exception of girls like Fenrir and Anubis, Love far outweighed feelings of Loyalty...</p><p>Instead of making Gray feel embarrassed by asking where she had learned such strange things, Vahn just framed the sides of her face before giving her a small heart attack when he closed the distance and sealed her lips with his own. Since he actually hadn't even kissed Artoria yet, Vahn was surprised by how 'sweet' Gray's saliva tasted as he led her tongue around like a seasoned dancer, matching her own natural tempo and breathing so she wouldn't suffocate. Though some girls liked the feeling of being 'starved' for air during a kiss, Vahn had long ago learned to never assume this was the case from the start. He would always change his intensity based on how passionate his partner's reactions were, this case taking things rather slow since Gray was almost entirely lacking experience...</p><p>Though she felt that Vahn had misunderstood her meaning, she dismissed the idea of 'correcting' him as her body was rapidly heating up after he started kissing her. She felt like her tongue was a rabbit being chased around by a fox but, every time it seemed ready to pounce on her, Vahn would change course, giving her the ability to escape as many times as she wanted. After a few seconds of this, Gray found her tongue naturally entwining with his, causing her thoughts to turn hazy as she felt the passage of time slip away from her. She hadn't even noticed Vahn's hands rubbing up and down the sides of her body until his fingers passed over two especially sensitive spots on her chest.</p><p>This caused an instinctual tremble to run through her body as she somewhat reluctantly separated from their long kiss to focus on her breathing...</p><p>With Gray leaning into his chest, her body's natural response to try and 'prevent' further stimulation, Vahn ran his hands down her back, sending gentle electrical surges into each of the nerves he passed along the way. This caused Gray's muscles to twitch lightly in response as she leaned more of her weight against his chest, her hot breath tickling his pectoral muscles since he had removed his shirt long ago. She was a little bit 'behind' what was happening but, by the time she realized that Vahn was bare-chested, it didn't particularly matter any longer. The heat from his body seemed to intermingle with her own, making Gray feel a little distracted as her skirt fell to the ground after a deft and almost indiscernible movement from Vahn's dexterous fingers...</p><p>The last time Vahn had seen her, Gray was wearing a pair of spats under her skirt, a 'neccessary' garment for any women who preferred to fight in a skirt. She apparently had no intention of fighting any 'normal' battles today as, instead of an elastic form-fitting fabric covering her hips, Vahn's eyes widened in surprise when he saw both a lot more and a lot less than he expected. Gray was wearing a pair of side-tie lace panties that were predominately gray with black lace forming a rather mature and intricate design that he hadn't quite expected from such a shy and bashful girl. He was once again reminded of the words Loki had spoken to him long ago, particularly those informing him that it was the quiet and shy girls he needed to be wary of. Though they might not say much outwardly, they could be having full conversations with themselves in their minds, many deviating on tangents most people would never expect...</p><p>Realizing that Gray had been harboring some expectations that 'something' would happen since the time he used 'Nirvana Rebirth' on her, Vahn felt an itch in his heart as he ran his left hand along the line of her back while using his right hand to gently massage her left butt cheek. This caused Gray to rest her forehead against his chest, the most natural location with their 30cm difference in height. She seemed to be trying to hide her face away from him as she focused on the sensations in her back and butt, special attention placed on the latter. Since he could feel her breathing become much hotter than before, causing a small amount of moisture to build upon his chest, Vahn spent a bit of time alternating his hands until Gray was more or less relying on him just to remain standing.</p><p>Understanding she was already more than ready to move on, Vahn slowly ran his hands up Gray's side, rolling up the elastic fabric of her thin blouse. He was already very aware of how her body was perspiring, causing the fabric to feel damp to the touch. When he peeled it free from her modest breasts, there was even a small spritz of vapor that caused Gray to spontaneously release a mewling whine as she lightly headbutted his chest. Unfortunately for her, the time to hide away had passed as Vahn quickly rolled the fabric until it reached her armpits. Though she was somewhat hesitant, Gray eventually raised her arms, linking them around Vahn's neck as she looked up at him with a 'melted' expression. Her eyes were completely covered in a layer of moisture as her cheeks were almost a sickening shade of red that flowed into her neck and ears...</p><p>Since he had already been working away at her for nearly thirty minutes, Vahn wasn't too surprised by the state Gray was in. This didn't mean it wasn't impactful, however, causing him to take in a sharp breath before sincerely stating, "You look beautiful..." before helping to remove her blouse the rest of the way. At this point, Gray didn't have it in her heart to resist anything Vahn wanted to do to her but, after hearing his words, she managed a bashful smile before wrapping her arms around his body once again. They hadn't even started having sex yet and she was already at a point that she wouldn't have even been able to comprehend previously. Instead of feeling afraid of what was to come, however, Gray felt more secure leaning into Vahn's embrace than when she had been held by her own mother in the past...</p><p>Though he wouldn't mind standing up, Vahn figured that Gray wasn't prepared for such 'exciting' experiences just yet. He still ended up lifting her body, but it was only to carry her over to the bed in a princess carry as he tucked her head into the nook of his neck. She had become very passive for the time being but, from prior experience, Vahn knew it wouldn't be long before Gray became far more proactive. Thus far, she had just been enjoying the pleasurable comfort of his caress but, once things finally reached the point of no return, her switch was almost guaranteed to be flipped. He had experienced this with girls like Lefiya, Preasia, Amaterasu, and, most recently, Lakshmibai...</p><p>After laying Gray down on the bed, she released a tired sigh without making any attempt to move on her own. Her lips were slightly parted and, with nothing but lace panties, black stockings, and the curious addition of black gloves, Gray's sex appeal had reached a critically effective level. Before his restraints could be completely destroyed, however, Vahn felt guilty having Artoria just sitting on the bed with her legs crossed as she watched in silence. He also wanted to increase the bond between the two girls as, in the future, Vahn would like to repeat this particular play several times. Though they were both unbelievably beautiful girls, seeing almost identical twins, their only discernible differences being their hair and color, more than doubled their individual appeal...</p><p>Seeing Vahn suddenly gesture for her to come over, Artoria was slightly startled as she almost felt like he had forgotten about her. Though her body was still warm, her panties had become somewhat cold several minutes ago due to the build-up of tension and having no means to release them. She had never masturbated before so Artoria was clueless when it came to dealing with her feminine urges without someone guiding her through the process. Due to Merlin's 'assistance', she had far more experience dealing with her tensions as a man instead of seeking relief as a woman. In total, she had only had sex seven times as a woman while the vast majority of her experience was trying and failing to please her wife...</p><p>Before she realized she had even moved, Artoria was already awkwardly at Vahn's side, following his instructions as he had her lay down next to Gray. Seeing her expression up close, Artoria's became increasingly redder as she couldn't help but wonder if this is what she looked like during sex. Gray had a somewhat sloppy expression with a heated look in her eyes, something that unnerved Artoria when she turned her stark blue eyes toward. When Vahn suddenly said, "Lay down and hold her hand for now...I'll deal with the both of you soon enough...", Artoria couldn't help but comply as she awkwardly watched Gray's expression as Vahn peeled off her stockings one at a time. She could feel Gray put more strength into her grip as her body tensed up in response to Vahn spreading her legs wide and shifting the angle of her hips. Artoria felt her own anxiety lessen when she noticed this, causing a comforting smile to appear on her face as she tightly squeezed Gray's hand and said, "Don't worry, everything will be fine..."</p><p>Though it wasn't Gray's first time, Vahn knew she wasn't really prepared for someone with his size and girth, regardless of his efforts. Unless he eased up the tension in her muscles, it would still be like prying her open so he wanted Artoria to support her through the preliminary stages. This would greatly reduce the distance between the two girls as, according to what he had been taught, there was a unique bond established when women 'overcame' the same struggle together. With that in mind, Vahn rubbed his glans along the slippery and hot flesh lining the inside of Gray's somewhat small vulva. Though she was in her late twenties, her body aged slower than normal, giving her an appearance only vaguely more mature than Artoria's fifteen-year-old figure. She was still more developed than Fenrir, however, so Vahn didn't feel the same kind of guilt he would sometimes experience with 'smaller' women...</p><p>Timing his movements with Gray's breathing and rhythm, Vahn waited until her body was in the ebb of a long orgasm to slowly force his way inside of her. This caused her to hold her breath, both eyes opening wide as she looked towards the ceiling with an incomprehensible expression of shock on her face. With the extremely long build-up, Gray's insides had become malleable from arousal so, even though he wasn't able to press his waist against her's, Vahn was able to knock against a firm yet flexible membrane at the very back of Gray's steamy cavern. The moment he touched the area, Gray released a short gasp as her legs snapped shut by instinct. Since he had already secured his position in her deepest parts, however, Gray's 'instincts' provided her no relief as Vahn made a small effort to part her knees, using a guiding tone as he said, "Relax your body...remember, I'm not going to hurt you..."</p><p>Though it took her a bit of effort, Gray managed to let her legs spread limply like a frog as she focused on her breathing. Vahn could see that she was tightly squeezing Artoria's hand, bringing a smile to his face as he began to gently rub Gray's abdomen while massaging Artoria's butt with his right hand. He was confident to claim 'mastery' in his ability to deal with three women, so handling two was well within Vahn's capabilities. Remarkably, though Gray's insides writhed about in a completely different way than Artoria's, Vahn experienced the same tingling phenomenon from both girls. Though Gray also had strands of grey and black mana within her circuits, showing an affinity with Death and Darkness, the larger flow of her mana was a pale gold that radiated like divine light. Her primary attribute, Holy, was the same as Artoria's so, with his 'weakness' against such girls, Vahn had to regulate his own breathing just to avoid finishing unexpectedly...</p><p>Around the same time that Gray's body had adapted to his size, indicated by the zero-distance between their hips, Gray suddenly wiped away the sweat from her brow before looking into Vahn's eyes and saying, "I'm okay now. You have already done more than enough...please, I want you to enjoy yourself as well...don't hold back..." At the end of her words, Gray wiggled her own hips a bit, even though it caused her to release a hot sigh in response. Vahn could tell she was only a few moments away from having her switch completely flipped as, instead of apprehension in her eyes, there was only expectation and building excitement...</p><p>Understanding that Gray wasn't actually prepared for 'everything' he could give, Vahn decided to ease her into things, even though he gave an understanding nod in response to her words. He lifted her right leg to make her hips twist slightly, something most people wouldn't be able to manage but Vahn could easily hold her like this for hours if necessary. As for why he chose to adjust her angle like this, Vahn felt a genttle 'pulse' against the left side of his glans from deep inside Gray's interior. This was the characteristic twitching of an especially sensitive spot so Vahn began to slowly piston as he scraped his glans across the small clump of nerves. This caused Gray's hips to spasm slightly with each of his movements as her eyes began to wandering around in their sockets before she ultimately closed her eyes. To match her conviction, Vahn began to steadily increase his pace until he was attacking Gray with a full-length piston, each movement punctuated by a direct attack to her sweet spot. It didn't even take a full minute before Gray twisted her body towards Artoria, surprising the somewhat distracted Knight by tightly hugging her body as she released a high-pitched moan, followed by Vahn's right thigh getting drenched in a warm and slightly viscous liquid...</p><p>(A/N: Alternate Titles: 'Artoria's skewed perspective...','RIP Gray's sensibilities...','Vahn is a bully')</p><p>https://bit.ly/2XBzAYu &lt;-(p.atreon link)</p><p>paypal.me/Einlion</p><p>Discord Invite: https://discord.gg/mn5xMbE</p></main><div class="link-group"><a class="btn" href="01099.html">Previous</a><a class="btn" href="index.html">Table of Contents</a><a class="btn" href="01101.html">Next</a></div></div><div id="readpos">0%</div></body></html>
