<p>Hearing Riveria's voice, Vahn's brain began to buzz and his expression completely froze on his face as he continued to hold her body. Riveria usually 'masked' her voice and made it sound more husky and masculine as part of the 'facade' she tried to maintain. Her actual voice, however, was soft and elegant and she had been unable to keep up herself from crying out in her real voice as a result of experiencing her first major orgasm. She seemed to realize this as well and actually tried to cover her mouth with her hands in an attempt to stifle her cries, exhaling through her nose while resisting the 'electrical' surge going through her body.</p><p>Vahn's hand became increasingly wet with Riveria's love juices and he noticed they were strangely viscous and would probably make for great lubricant for what was to come. Pulling his hand free from her panties, Vahn spread his fingers apart and created a 'thread' between his thumb and index finger, something Riveria noticed through her fluttering eyelashes. She trembled in embarrassment but Vahn just continued to hold her body while saying a few soothing words until she was able to calm down. He then helped her lay back against the bed, saying, "I think your real voice is very attractive...it actually made my mind go blank for a moment when I heard you cry out." Vahn had a loving smile on his face that made Riveria feel like he was being very 'unfair' to her by saying things like that in this situation.</p><p>Riveria's thoughts had been racing ever since Vahn started to lay her down and, hearing his words, she bit her bottom lip almost painfully before saying, "I'll try to talk more normally in the future..." The fact that she used her 'real' voice to say those words made Vahn smile 'radiantly' and Riveria had to squint her eyes and look away out of embarrassment. Vahn currently looked like a very young High Elven boy and Riveria felt like she was being bullied a bit just because of how handsome he was. She typically didn't care about looks that much, but Vahn was now her husband and the person she had decided to dedicate herself to. Having her partner be a handsome young boy made her very nervous because it almost felt 'wrong' to be on the receiving end...</p><p>Noticing Riveria was getting a little 'distracted' again, Vahn's smile softened and he traced his left hand across the right side of her body, causing her to tremble slightly in response. Undaunted, Vahn caressed the side of her hips, gently touching her soft butt with his fingertips, before moving down to her fair white thighs that were, like most girls of Elven heritage, somewhat thin but still very soft to the touch. Her skin actually glistened under the sunlight and the very light layer of sweat made her look very appealing, almost as if she was a fruit ripe for picking. Bringing his hand around her knee, Vahn pulled up the back of it gently and asked, "Are you ready, Riveria, or did you want me to help you prepare a bit more...?"</p><p>Riveria furrowed her brows slightly because, no matter how she answered, it was almost like she would be 'asking' for it. She actually expected Vahn to be a bit more aggressive than this but, after remembering his earlier promise to be gentle, Riveria understood she should have probably just asked him to act 'normally'. Thinking of the best way to save her some embarrassment, Riveria said, "We're husband and wife now, so I'm already prepared for whatever is going to happen...I'll leave the rest to you..." As if she couldn't tolerate looking directly at him, Riveria turned her head to the side, almost like she was pouting. Vahn felt her actions were very adorable and was tempted to tease her a bit but knew it was probably not the right time.</p><p>Vahn parted Riveria's legs, which had been squeezed together almost instinctually, and moved his body between her while she watched him from the corner of her eyes, trembling all the while. Seeing the sight of her slightly parted legs, Vahn gulped and once again marveled at Riveria's natural beauty that was leagues above most normal girls. It could be a result of her High Elven heritage, or perhaps because she was a Princess, but she had a strangely noble aura even when she was blushing and on her back. Vahn felt a strange desire to 'conquer' her but threw it to the back of his mind for the time being and just moved his hands under Riveria's legs, reaching around to the sides of her panties. Grabbing the elastic band of the silky fabric, Vahn pulled it along Riveria's long legs, raising them up in the process since her legs needed to come together unless he wanted to store them in his Inventory. Vahn knew the buildup was very important, especially for a woman's first time, so he didn't just 'magically' throw them aside since it would unnecessarily 'shock' her mind.</p><p>When her legs came back down, Riveria had closed them once again and it took marginally more effort to part her knees than it had previously. At this point, Riveria's trembling had actually stopped but Vahn could still see her jaw quivering slightly as she turned her eyes away when he looked over. She actually adopted a posture of holding her hands together between her breasts, almost like she was either praying or trying to conceal her breasts as she 'waited' for what was going to happen. Vahn knew she wouldn't be able to keep that up for long so he just admired her predominately naked figure for a moment, saying, "You truly are an incredible beauty, my darling little wife..."</p><p>Hearing the way Vahn addressed her, Riveria looked at him from the corner of her eyes before taking a deep breath and turning to face him directly. As if answering his future question, Riveria nodded her head and said, "I'm ready...my...husband..." while taking the 'initiative' to open her legs, just a little. Riveria was currently completely shaven and Vahn found that she had a 'neat' little line that was tightly closed to the point that the love juices emerging from her actually beaded out like tears. In her entire life, Riveria hadn't so much as touched herself down there except when bathing. Compared to most girls, she was actually grossly unprepared, even considering those much younger than her.</p><p>Vahn had already taken her physical constitution into account and, though he hadn't changed the overall length too much, he had reduced the girth of his penis out of consideration for Riveria. Since he had been with her for a while, Vahn knew she hadn't taken any medicine to 'prepare' herself and he didn't want to make things painful. Moving closer to her body, Vahn parted her legs until they were resting against the bed, causing Riveria to flush deeply as she watched each of his actions closely. Vahn pressed a few 'key' pressure points around her bod before placing his palm at the 'core' of her formation, right above where her uterus was located. Riveria was already breathing deeply at this point but she didn't say anything to stop his actions and just balled her hands up tightly in preparation.</p><p>Confident things wouldn't be too painful for her at this point, Vahn grabbed his penis and placed it at Riveria's slit, rubbing it up and down to lubricate it while making sure to put a bit of pressure to stimulate her clitoris. Riveria's legs tried to close but they obviously couldn't move through Vahn's body and barely interfered with his shallow movements at all. Vahn's eyes darted around in thought for a moment before he leaned over Riveria and said, "I'm going to kiss you...hug my body with your arms and, if you can manage it later, use your legs as well..." After a bit of 'study', Vahn knew all kinds of positions and wanted to lead Riveria into one called a 'mating press' later on which was supposedly a way to increase the chance of fertilization.</p><p>Though she had the basic knowledge about reproduction, Riveria actually had no real knowledge or experience to draw from and simply followed Vahn's words, loosely hugging his body as he brought himself closer to her and began kissing her. At first, it was just a normal kiss but his constant attempts to probe her mouth with his tongue eventually caused her to open her mouth and things became much more passionate. All the while, Vahn continued to rub his 'ridiculously' hot member against her lower body and Riveria felt a strange urge, almost like she wanted to cry or hit Vahn as a giddy feeling welled up inside of her lower body. Instead, she just hugged him harder as it became increasingly harder to breathe under the 'assault' of his tongue...</p><p>Vahn had noticed this in the past, but all the bodily fluids of Elves seemed to be especially sweet and the fragrances coming from their bodies was always flowery or emulated other 'natural' smells. Perhaps as a result of her High Elven heritage, but this was seemed to be even more prominent in Riveria, causing Vahn to almost want to suck the saliva from her lips while they were kissing. He could tell she was starting to get into things as well since she had stopped thinking so much and was just allowing her body to respond while they were kissing. The biggest indicator for this was the fact that Vahn found the viscous walls of Riveria's vagina had 'softened' up a great deal as their lukewarm heat became a very comfortable and pleasant warmth.</p><p>Using his right hand, Vahn probed near the base of Riveria's vagina until he found an indentation and, after confirming the slight expansion around his glans, Vahn knew it was the entrance to her vagina. To make sure, he dragged his glans through the walls over her vulva before 'flicking' the sensitive nerve cluster at the very top. Riveria's hips twitched when he did this so Vahn traced back down, barely noticing the slightly firm area where her urethra was located, before settling against the entrance once again. Riveria's movements stopped almost entirely at this point and she stopped kissing him passionately as her teeth snapped shut in preparation. So as not to waste her efforts, Vahn pushed forward as the small entrance slowly expanded to the size of his glans...</p><p>As a Level 6, Riveria was already very resistant to pain and wouldn't have had any trouble even without Vahn's 'preparations'. Because he had put in so much effort, however, Riveria noticed there was almost no pain at all and, other than a strange 'pressure' and a giddy feeling in her stomach there was only a sense that her body was being 'gently' pried open. After the head was completely inside, Riveria released a sigh because she felt like the 'worst' part of things was over. When Vahn began pressing his hips further, Riveria realized this wasn't the case at all so she followed Vahn's earlier words and just hugged him tightly in response. She wasn't sure if he meant to do it now, but Riveria also tried to wrap her legs around his because she thought he was relying on her to 'guide' him in...</p><p>Vahn was surprised by Riveria's sudden 'eagerness' and thought she wanted to hurry things along so she could adapt more quickly. Taking her feelings into consideration, Vahn moved forward a little faster and quickly passed through a 'seemingly' fragile membrane before coming to a stop much sooner than he expected. Riveria groaned and continued clinging to his body for a while before squeezing her legs in a 'testing' manner. Noticing it wasn't nearly as painful as she expected, Riveria released a very relieved sigh and relaxed her body against the back. She had actually hugged Vahn hard enough to lift her body from the bed and he had to stabilize them both with his left hand so as not to 'lose' the angle.</p><p>Riveria looked up into Vahn's jade-green eyes, as he wasn't currently using his [Eyes of Truth], and took several deep breaths before smiling and saying, "That wasn't so bad..." Vahn showed a large grin in response and exhaled through his nose to stifle a laugh. He had previously been focusing on the 'pulsation' from her vagina which, just like Ryuu, matched her heart rate and made Vahn feel even closer to her. As she was a virgin, Riveria was incredibly tight but Vahn had 'loosened' the muscles around the area beforehand so it wasn't that difficult to get through. The more surprising thing was that Riveria's vagina was very 'shallow' and Vahn hadn't even gotten halfway inside of her before reaching a dead end...</p><p>As if she had also noticed the 'awkward' position of Vahn's hips, Riveria loosened her legs and looked to the side to see how they were connected. Seeing Vahn so 'far' away from her made Riveria gulp audibly before blushing when she realized what she had just done. She already felt completely 'full' and, even though it wasn't painful, Riveria didn't feel that it was that pleasurable either. Similar to Ryuu, Riveria was far more sensitive in her breasts and ears than her actual vagina, with the number of nerves in the area being far fewer than most races. Vahn actually felt like this was one of the reasons why Elven Fertility was an issue because they didn't seem to enjoy intravaginal sex very much. Fortunately, he wasn't lacking in experience and 'startled' Riveria by suddenly pinching her nipple.</p><p>Riveria felt like she had been shocked suddenly so she looked at Vahn with a look of blame only to see him showing a very soft and affectionate smile. Unable to hold his gaze, Riveria turned her head and just trembled when he began tracing his finger around her areola. Before she could actually 'adapt', Vahn leaned forward and, instead of trying to kiss Riveria, began nibbling the top side of her right ear. Riveria turned her head as if she were trying to escape but Vahn let a thread of energy flow from his fingers into her nipple, causing Riveria to shock him this time around. He almost 'refused' to believe it, but Riveria had 'squeaked' just like Ryuu had in the past...</p><p>When he lifted his head to look at her, Riveria was wide-eyed and covering her mouth with both hands as a crimson blush spread through her cheeks, several shades brighter than it was previously. Unable to keep it to himself, Vahn said in a very serious tone, "Riveria...that was unbelievably cute...I want to hear it again..." He wasn't really trying to 'tease' her, but Vahn felt like he 'needed' to hear her squeak like that again or his time in this record wouldn't be near as fulfilling. Riveria shook her head from side-to-side very quickly and continued to cover her mouth as if she adamantly refused to let him hear it again.</p><p>Vahn released a 'sad' sigh and muttered, "It's fine...I just hope you'll open up to me a bit more in the future. Having a beautiful and intelligent wife that also has a cute side to her...sounds very nice..." Without waiting for her 'response', Vahn leaned down and began nibbling and sucking on Riveria's ear again while she tightly closed her eyes to 'resist' the pleasure that made her feel very anxious, almost like she was going to lose herself. Even when she tried to channel her mana to calm her mind, Riveria found that she would quickly lose her focus the moment one of the 'shocks' came from Vahn's fingers. With her hands covering her mouth, she couldn't put up any resistance at all against his hands and this was before he even started moving his hips.</p><p>Almost as if he had received a divine cue, Vahn pressed a bit of his weight into Riveria to test the flexibility of her cervix and see if he could push it up at all. Like most girls, Riveria's uterus was at a different angle than her vagina itself and the cervix actually had a bit of flexibility where the glans could slip behind it in some cases. This could be very stimulating for some girls, as there were nerves that connected to the colon nearby, but it also increased the risk of infection if targetted exclusively. Vahn tried to poke against the entrance of the cervix and 'push' against it because he knew the interior of the vagina could expand up to 200% for some women, given him more than enough room to get inside if she were aroused enough. He didn't want to force her, as Vahn never wanted to cause any of the girls around him a sexual trauma, but it was somewhat difficult for him to stay 'outside' more than halfway...</p><p>So as not to cause Riveria any discomfort, Vahn turned off his [Hands of Nirvana] and began using his [Petting] to full effect to help her relax while also stimulating her erogenous zones. She would periodically tense up her body, obviously trying to resist producing any 'embarrassing' sounds, but Vahn believed he could get her to drop her guard eventually. Moving his mouth to the very tip of her ear, the most sensitive spot, Vahn began sucking on it while rolling it with his tongue, causing Riveria to show a great deal of panic on her face. She wasn't getting enough oxygen through just her nose and she kept holding her breath to try and stifle her own moans and the small 'squeak' Vahn wanted to hear.</p><p>Though she had already 'expected' it, Riveria was surprised by how 'proficient' Vahn was because he was targetting three different spots with varying amounts of pleasure and it felt like she was going to lose her mind out of frustration sooner or later. Her first time was supposed to be something a little painful and relatively quick, not some slow an 'agonizing' stimulus that made her feel completely overwhelmed. Though it was very pleasurable, Riveria was scared she would get washed away by it and there had been a very 'dangerous' feeling welling up in the back of her mind for a while now...</p><p>Vahn was very sensitive to all the changes in Riveria's body and the minute fluctuations of her aura, knowing exactly when to target one area over the others. He even made sure to switch sides while 'curiously' trying to find any weak spots by probing her depths, thus far not having any real success. Fortunately, the tips of her ears were incredibly sensitive and Riveria didn't seem like she would be able to hold out much longer as the palpitations in her vagina had become intermixed with powerful vibrations that continued to build. It was very stimulating for him, so Vahn expected it was even more so for Riveria as small beads of tears came out of the corners of her eyes. He knew she was holding herself back a lot at this point but it was very 'important' that she learn to relax more when they are together since it will make things far less complicated in the future...</p><p>Sensing she was near the 'peak', Vahn tilted his body a bit and allowed some of his weight to rest on Riveria's body as he supported himself with his elbow. He began to kiss the backside of her hands, almost as if he would be able to eventually pry through them, using his free hand and placing it over the surprisingly hot scale near Riveria's navel. He had already let his own tensions build to a critical level so Vahn was fully prepared, which was somewhat bad news for Riveria, as he introduced a steady flow of energy into the [Sage Aldrnari's Blessing] while simultaneously releasing his source energy-rich semen into the back of her vagina. This also coincided with Riveria's own climax so her eyes shot open as she released a loud, "Iyyaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaahn!?" at the top of her lungs.</p><p>Vahn felt his ears ringing as Riveria took rapid breaths while writhing about underneath him, almost as if she wanted to escape, all the while saying, "It's too much...the mana...it's filling me up completely!" Unable to actually muster any strength, Riveria laid against the bed in the throes of an incredibly powerful orgasm, unlike anything she had even though possible. She didn't enter a 'blank' state like other girls, much like how Ryuu also kept her senses, so Riveria was 'forced' to deal with the powerful climax while being fully aware of everything that was happening. It felt like she couldn't even sense her own mana anymore, almost likes Vahn's was completely invading her even though her senses told her it was only in her lower body. It was a very terrifying experience because Riveria felt like she would never be able to leave him if things were always like this...not that she ever intended to...</p><p>While Riveria was 'twitching' about as a result of her nerves firing off like fireworks int he night sky, Vahn reached down and hugged her tightly, saying, "Wrap your legs around me and try to calm down..." Though she was somewhat hesitant, Riveria still listened to Vahn's words and was surprised to find that it actually felt much more tolerable to cling to him than simply lay down and let the scary sensations wrack her body. Realizing this, Riveria hugged him tightly and felt very comfortable when Vahn also cradled her in his incredibly warm embrace. It felt like she was in a furnace, but the heat from his body made it easier to bear the chaotic energy that was slowly beginning to stabilize around her womb and navel...</p><p>For a few minutes, Vahn just held Riveria tightly while she clung to his body as if he were the only anchor point in a vast ocean. He had actually lifted up her butt a bit by placing his knees to support her thighs and was around 60% inside of her as her vagina continued to pulse and throb like a chaotic heartbeat. The interior writhed about in an incredibly stimulating way but Vahn just focused his mind while observing the changes in Riveria's body, confirming the formation was working as expected and that she was undoubtedly going to get pregnant.</p><p>From the very moment he ejaculated inside of her, it was like something had been triggered in her body, causing Riveria's womb to begin absorbing the energy from his semen. This worked in conjunction with the formation carved into her body and created a loop where the excess energy was fed into the mana core around her navel before returning to the source once again. Her ovaries actually gave a surprising response because Vahn sensed they had produced more than one egg, something he hadn't expected at all. It was a little strange but Vahn knew it would be very bad for Riveria if she had to bear multiple children at once so he had to sadly get rid of the extra eggs. She still had several hundred thousand eggs safely stowed away in her ovaries so it wouldn't make a big difference. However, Vahn still felt a little unnerved when he did this but knew it was necessary, not just for the safety of Riveria, but for their children as well...</p><p>(A/N: Alternate Titles: 'Soft And Elegant','Om nom nom','Ovaries be like: Now is the time, charge~!')</p><p>https://www.*******.com/user?u=14397149</p><p>paypal.me/Einlion</p><p>Discord Invite: https://discord.gg/Jwa8PKh</p></main><div class="link-group"><a class="btn" href="00612.html">Previous</a><a class="btn" href="../index.html">Table of Contents</a><a class="btn" href="00614.html">Next</a></div></div><div class="right-icon theme"><input type="image" id="themeButton" src="https://i.imgur.com/PWAzExk.png" height="25"></div><div id="readpos">0%</div><script src="../js/theme.js"></script></body></html>
