<p>After her little accident, Lili lost a bit of her momentum and sat at the side with a beet red face while Vahn cleaned up the mess. She had been very nervous during breakfast and drank a lot of water without thinking about it. It hadn't even crossed her mind to go to the bathroom before and, as climaxing sometimes felt like a strong urge to pee, Lili had dropped her guard at the last moment. By the time the dam had been broken, nothing could stop the flooding of the dragon valley. Lili had never been so embarrassed in her entire life and it suddenly became much harder to make eye contact with Vahn.</p><p>As for Vahn himself, he just had a casual smile on his face with slightly dulled eyes as he mechanically used magic. In the other room, things were getting rather intense with Naaza and it took a great deal of focus to case magic under such circumstances. It was fortunate that Lili wasn't looking at him or it was very likely she would have noticed the abnormality...</p><p>After cleaning up everything, Vahn knew he would have to take the initiative for a little while so looked toward Lili's small figure before laying back down on the now dried bed. Lili looked over, seeing Vahn with his hands behind his head in a relaxed manner as he said, "That was an interesting experience, hahahaha~." Lili's blush turned crimson as she exclaimed, "Vahn! You can't laugh at a time like this~! You, you, you, you jerk!" Vahn, with a completely innocent look on his face smiled to Lili and asked, "Are you going to let such a small setback stop you...?"</p><p>Hearing his words, Lili uttered an 'Eh?' while her mental processes slowly caught up with what was happening. She realized Vahn was just trying to break her free from her embarrassment since it would have made things even more awkward if she was left to brood. Still, seeing him 'relaxing' made her want to punish him a bit, even though she knew it was probably a means to 'bait' her into taking action. Pointing towards his face with a look of resentment on her's, Lili exclaimed, "Take off your pants! I'll teach you to laugh at me, Vahn!"</p><p>Vahn raised his brow in a taunting manner and, without changing his pose, instantly removed all of his clothing. Lili's eyes widened and he could see her visibly tilt slightly when his dragon roared towards the heavens, undaunted, untamed, and completely beyond her capabilities to 'teach' in a practical manner. Even though he had actually made it slightly more compact, as Lili shouldn't know his 'normal' size, it still struck a very imposing figure that made Lili's eyes widen into perfect circles. Still, seeing the taunting look on Vahn's face, Lili swallowed hard and, surprisingly, slapped both of her cheeks pretty hard to psyche herself up.</p><p>With two hand prints on her cheeks, Lili scuttled over to Vahn's side and, after a bit of hesitation, straddled his thighs. Because of the difference in their hip width, Lili had to spread her legs pretty wide and, having already removed her panties earlier, Vahn could see a glimpse of her forbidden territory through the gap in her skirt. Lili didn't seem to notice this, however, as her eyes were completely fixed on the majestic dragon before her. It felt like she just had to bend down slightly and she would be able to touch it with her face...</p><p>Vahn though she was still intimidated and was about to say something before forcibly swallowing his words when Lili suddenly asked, "Is it smaller than normal...?" with a hard tone to her voice. Even without answering, Lili understood the truth of the matter and made a small pout as she moved her hips closer to his erect member. She unhesitantly grabbed it with her scarily small hands before straddling her plush and hot mound against the base. Lili began breathing a little heavily from the contact, muttering, "It's hot..." in a quiet voice while placing it against her stomach. When she saw how far up it went, any complaints she had about Vahn decreasing his became locked away inside of her heart. She knew it wouldn't actually reach up that far, but Lili felt like Vahn would almost be able to reach her diaphragm if he was in his 'normal' size...</p><p>Deciding to let the matter lay, Lili moved her hips further forward until Vahn's penis became pressed to his own stomach. Lili saw it reached all the way to his belly button and felt a tension in her lower body as she imagined just how far it would reach inside of her. Even so, she continued her previous action and dragged her entrance up his length while repeating her earlier inquiries, "So...how does it feel...?" Though she wouldn't be able to keep it up for long, Lili wanted to at least try to follow her previous plan to get a rise out of Vahn.</p><p>Vahn's eyes were firmly fixed to where Lili was rubbing herself against him. Her somewhat puffy vagina had a mind-numbing softness, a very discernable heat, and was already highly lubricated as a result of her own excitement. Likely as a preparation for today, Lili was also completely hairless and it made the sight look even more dangerous as a result. A part of him was very resistant to the idea of actually putting his penis inside of her but, as she had asked him a question, Vahn answered, "It is very soft...and hot...and a little slimy..."</p><p>Lili released a small laugh, commenting, "Don't say something like 'slimy'...jeez..." Even though she complained, Lili had a smile on her face as she slowly moved her hips up and down. She was very aware of the complications of them having sex and had already taken twice the amount of medicine as normal to make sure her body would be able to adapt. This was one of the reasons why she was especially 'squishy' right now, because the pliability of her sexual organ had been pushed to an extreme that was very atypical of a virgin woman. The most painful part would be having her hymen severed, but Lili was confident she could resist the pain after her strenuous physical training.</p><p>As before, Lili continued her movements as her body steadily heated up and Vahn's penis was completely covered in her love nectar. Every time his hot glans rubbed against her clitoris, Lili released a hot sigh and continued speeding up her movements until a second wave of pleasure passed through her body. It wasn't nearly as powerful as her previous one, as a result of her tensions have eased slightly, but they both noticed an abnormality that made Lili curse. When she climaxed, a very small amount of liquid that was vastly different than her love juice mixed into a cocktail of fluids. Vahn had the courtesy to not say anything but Lili felt very frustrated since she realized her body must have an inclination towards 'squirting'. This wasn't the first time she had climaxed before, not even close, but the excitement this time around was making her body react in a very different way than the past...</p><p>Since Vahn kept quiet about it, Lili gave him a bashful and grateful smile before doing her best to appear as seductive and sensual as possible. Very slowly, Lili began to unbutton her blouse while moving her hips back and forward, urging her body to stay warm for what was to come. After peeling away her blouse, the only vestiges of clothing that remained were her white lace bra, matching the panties she had worn previous, and the dark blue skirt she was wearing around her hips. Lili kept eye contact with Vahn the entire time, peeling off her skirt before moving her hands up in a flexible display as she very easily unclasped her bra. With the tension released, the bands of the bra slid down her shoulders and released her rather large, for her size, puppies. They were a very fair color compared to her relatively tanned skin and Lili felt slightly embarrassed by how her little beads were standing excitedly.</p><p>Vahn eyed Lili's breasts and, without asking permission, reaching his hand out to give them a gentle squeeze, sampling their feel with his palm. Lili released a 'pained' moan as she said, "Not so rough..." in a small voice. Vahn nodded and, in an even gentler manner, lightly squeezed Lili's soft breast with his fingers. Lili closed her eyes, bit her lip, and just continued to rock her body slightly while enjoying the sensation of Vahn playing with her breasts. She had always been sensitive about them because, while she had been subjected to the cruelty of the Soma Familia, some of the Familia members would make comments about them. The men that had planned to sell her as a sex slave had always made snide comments about how 'well' she was developing...</p><p>Shaking those dark thoughts from her mind, Lili opened her eyes to meet the gentle and understanding smile on Vahn's face. She gave her own smile in return, saying, "Vahn...I have no way of expressing how thankful I am to you with just my words...so let me do it with my body...I want you to know just how much I love you..." Lili felt a third wave slowly creep up on her and decided she was ready, even if no amount of preparation would truly prepare her for what is to come. Even so, Lili didn't care about that at all and, just as she had 'adapted' in the past, the was another thing she would overcome. The difference is, unlike in the past, where she acted for her survival, she now acted for her own happiness...for the love she had...the love she 'shared' with Vahn...</p><p>Knowing what was coming, Vahn nearly offered to make things easier for her but, someone as prideful as Lili, wouldn't give in so easily. Even so, he planned to ease her burden after the fact, regardless of how she felt about the situation. Any resentment she had would fade with time, something Vahn was very aware of, so it was fine to shoulder her ire for a short while. In truth, he was 'terrified' of actually having sex with Lili because he didn't want to hurt her. This wasn't enough to make him take a step back, however, so the only thing he could do was deal with the aftermath as best he was able. Fortunately, as intense as it was, things between him and Naaza weren't very complicated and his dual-focus was slowly shifting towards Lili, at least for the time being.</p><p>Lili lifted her hips and, realizing she actually couldn't reach the tip from her knees, repositioned herself so that she was squatting above his hips. With how soft the bed was, it was difficult to squat in such a manner but Lili's core muscles and balance were developed to the extremes. She also had an incredible amount of flexibility and hoped it would help make things easier on her, at least until she had 'adapted'. As for Vahn, he had started breathing very quickly and both of his brains were buzzing as he watched Lili squat above his hips. He helped support her with his hands as she maneuvered his glans to her puffy and dangerous-looking entrance. Vahn almost felt like his glans themselves were larger than her vulva and, as he watched them stretch to 'consume' the head of his proud dragon, Vahn felt like time had slowed to a crawl...</p><p>Things weren't much better for Lili and, as she was maneuvering his glans into her own entrance, her body was trembling quite a bit. It almost felt like it was impossible to find the actual entrance to her vagina but, after more effort than she'd have liked, Lili finally found the spot inside of herself that began to give away. She began taking several deep breaths and was vaguely aware of the warm and calming energy coming through Vahn's palms as she began to lower her hips.</p><p>The amount of effort it took for her to get the entire head inside made a part of her mind begin to panic as it screamed for her to reconsider. Completely ignoring that tiny voice, Lili looked into Vahn's eyes with a very serious expression and said, "I love you..." She had noticed that Vahn had actually become a little pale but, when he heard her words, his eyes regained their focus as he confidently replied, "I love you too, Lili..." With his words filling her with confidence, Lili buried that tiny voice away in the back of her mind, took a very deep breath, and began wiggling her hips while 'forcefully' lowering her body against his...</p><p>Vahn felt a tightness that was almost comparable to Hestia's as Lili practically 'pried' herself open with his member. At the same time, he began to channel a tidal wave of energy through her shoulders as Lili completely tore through her own hymen and continued going until she reached a dead end. The breath that she held previously seemed to be stuck in her throat as her body began to tremble greatly, even with his energy helping ease her discomfort. When it finally found its way out of her throat, Lili released a choked "A...aah..." before it continued to increase in volume and became a full-on "AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAGGHHHHUKKK!" Following that, she began to cry heavy tears as she repeated, "It hurts, it hurts, it hurts..." over and over.</p><p>Feeling his own body trembling a great deal, Vahn's [Eyes of Truth] activated to make sure Lili didn't hurt herself too badly. The difference in their size, even with his reduction and the medicine she had taken, was simply incompatible. He could see several contusions within the interior of her vice-like vagina, completely ignoring the area where her hymen had been. Vahn began repairing the damage and doing his best to ease Lili's pain while supporting her body with his right hand. She tightly held his arm and continued to cry before realizing what was happening. With an aggrieved expression on her face, Lili tried to say, "Noo...no...stop..." between pained breaths. Lili had always expected it to be painful but it was a pain she 'wanted', almost to the point that she 'needed' to experience it. She had always felt very guilty about the pain Vahn had gone through on her behalf and wanted this to be the moment when she repaid that debt that had carved itself into her heart...</p><p>Vahn had an idea of what was going through Lili's mind but, even if she felt like he had wronged her, his only response was a loving smile and the words, "I love you..." Lili blinked when she heard this and her frustrated expression softened a bit. Vahn raised his body slowly into a sitting position, hugging Lili's small and seemingly frail body as he repeated, "I love you, Lili...I don't want you to be in pain..." He made sure not to sit up all the way because he didn't want her weight dropping down onto him. At this point, barely 10cm of his length was inside of her and she was adapting to the intrusion 'very' slowly on her own.</p><p>Any resentment Lili felt had started to melt away faster and faster, every time Vahn repeated those magic words into her ears. Though she was in an awkward position, half-squatting while he hugged her, Lili felt comforted by his large frame and warm embrace. She wrapped her arms around his body and began to hug him in turn, nuzzling against his bare chest as she fought to control her tears. The pain was quickly subsiding under Vahn's efforts, but Lili still felt like crying. Vahn was always looking out for her and, now that they had finally become one, Lili felt like she was sinking to the bottom of an ocean comprised entirely of her own emotions. The deeper she sunk into that abyss, the harder Lili cried and it wasn't until nearly twenty minutes later that she managed to calm down...</p><p>While still tightly clinging to his body, Lilu muttered in a quiet voice that was hoarse from her previous wailing, "This didn't go quite as I expected..." Vahn released a very light laugh, stroking Lili's back in a small circle as he mused, "That's how life is at times...we can make all the plans in the world but, the moment we have to face reality, things can break down in an instant. I've come to understand that this is one of the things that make life beautiful though...otherwise, moments like this, where I can feel so close to the people I love, wouldn't exist...tell me Lili, can you feel the love I have for you...?" As he spoke, Vahn hugged Lili's head to his chest so she could hear and feel his heart beating.</p><p>Lili listened to the powerful beating of Vahn's heart, which was excitedly throbbing inside of his chest. She also felt the steady flow of energy through her back and, though he likely didn't want her to focus on it, she was 'very' aware of the intruding object that felt like it had completely filled her up. The pain was no longer present, now replaced by a mild discomfort, and Lili was feeling a small urge to move around. She noticed that the 'ache' that had followed her for the last year had faded away, almost as if Vahn had completely shattered it, and it made her heart feel at ease. Replaying his words in her mind, Lili knew that this 'reality', this moment when she was connected with the man she loved, really was worth all the pain she had experienced previously. Those memories, the people that had hurt her, none of them mattered remotely as much as this one singular instance in her life...</p><p>Silence reigned in the room for a few minutes with only the sound of Lili's breathing any indicator that time hadn't stopped. Then, as if she couldn't wait any longer, Lili flexed her abdominal muscles and caused Vahn to exhale sharply through his nose. Giggling at his response, Lili raised her tear-stained face to match his gaze and said, "I know you didn't want me to become reliant on you, but I'm not sure I can help myself if you're always so reliable..." While she was breathing, Lili had begun to flex her abdominal muscles as tightly as possible while slowly moving her hips. She wasn't satisfied with how little progress she had made and, knowing someone like Hestia had managed to take in Vahn's full length, Lili set her goal as accepting his current length...</p><p>Lili was a very powerful Adventurer now and almost all of her parameters leaned towards her physical development, especially Power and Endurance. She had trained her body into a powerful weapon and, every time she flexed, Vahn felt like she was trying to compress his dragon into a noodle. Fortunately, he had experienced with girls like Hestia so it was more of a comfortable pressure than something painful. Still remembering her previous words, Vahn leaned down, arching his back more than he would have thought necessary, and began kissing Lili's small and sweet lips. She really was very tiny so, even while sitting in his lap, Vahn had to crane his neck just to be able to kiss her, something that was only possible if she tilted her head back to accept.</p><p>Though she could continue holding it for a while longer, Lili began to find her current position very uncomfortable because she had been squatting for nearly a half-hour. The kiss with Vahn required her to lean back awkwardly and it made other movements very difficult. She pushed against his chest to break free from the kiss and said, "Lay down properly...I'm fine now...fuuu..." Vahn nodded his head and, though it might not have been appropriate for the situation, habitually rubbed Lili's hair before doing as she suggested. Lili gave an exasperated sigh before moving her feet into a better position and supporting herself with Vahn's strong abdominal muscles.</p><p>She had tried moving earlier, but Lili quickly realized a problem as Vahn simply moved with her. It was like he was wedged into her insides and, unless she pulled out, it didn't seem like they were going to make any progress any time soon. Deciding it was time for 'drastic' measures, Lili moved her hips a few times before releasing a helpless sigh and saying, "I'm going to use my [Cinder*Ella]. I've already given you my virginity and now I want to enjoy having sex with you...my body isn't adapting fast enough and I can't even move with your stupidly large meat rod jammed inside of me..." Vahn felt like his brain had dulled when he heard Lili's words but, before he could say anything in response, she had already cast her magic, surprising Vahn by the race she had selected. At the same time, Lili fell like an anchor and released a loud yelp-like moan as a result.</p><p>Instead of her previously tanned skin, Lili now had a healthy brown complexion while her chestnut brown hair had become almost black in color. Her muscles, which had always been somewhat prominent under her soft and supple skin, now became slightly more firm and glossy. When she opened her eyes, they were also much darker than normal and Lili had a satisfied smile on her face as she moved her hips slightly. This small movement caused her to release a very sensual moan as she said, "Nnnn...I know this would be the best choice...what is with this body...Nnngh~!" Vahn was still surprised by her transformation and, even without asking, could tell by the way her vagina was 'devouring' his penis that Lili had transformed into an Amazoness...</p><p>As if to answer his confusion, Lili chuckled lightly and, while continuing to move her hips, explained, "I spend a lot of time with Tiona and Tione, so I know the 'benefits' enjoyed by Amazons. This was the trump card I had prepared for today and, since you might have to deal with Kali in the future, I thought this would be good training for you...hafuuu~!" Lili had tightened up her abdominal muscles again, twisting her hips around his member as a shudder ran up from his back. At the same time, Vahn tried to make sense of Lili's words and remembered that Kali, the Goddess responsible for Tiona's and Tione's tragic pasts, was arguably more petite than Lili. However, he had never really thought about ever being together with her in such a manner...</p><p>Lili, understanding his confusion but feeling a strange frustration by his distraction, explained, "We know you need to win the affection of Goddesses with Space, Time, and Fate based Divinities. Kali has Death, which is related to fate, and Time, two things that would be helpful for your future plans. If you can actually conquer her, it will go a long way towards bringing about change in the Amazon country of Telskyura. Other than the Queen of the Amazons, she has the greatest amount of influence and many Amazonesses are very faithful to the belief system she propagates..." Though she was explaining things as clearly as she could, Lili felt a strong urge welling up inside of her to try and 'dominate' Vahn...</p><p>Vahn noticed Lili was putting a lot more strength into her movements than was necessary and, though he had been somewhat distracted by her words, understood what was going on. It was a scary thought but Vahn realized he would have to 'defeat' Lili unless he wanted to be on the losing end of the situation. She was a very strong girl so, if he let her take control of things, it wouldn't end well for him, even with his regeneration ability. However, there was another thought creeping up inside his mind so he asked, "Lili...are you trying to get pregnant...?" When she heard this, Lili's vagina tightened like a vice and he could feel her cervix practically 'kissing' his glans while a powerful suction came from her womb.</p><p>Lili showed an expectant smile and peered at him through her one parted eye before saying, "I never did tell you what my dream was...did I~?" From the small figure of Lili, Vahn suddenly felt a great deal of pressure as the smile on her face became much larger as she exclaimed, "I don't want to lose to anyone, especially myself...since I had three children in the Divination, I want to have even more this time around...don't worry though, I'll leave it up to fate to decide when I get pregnant..." Though she said that, both Vahn and Lili understood the implication behind her transforming into an Amazoness. If he left her to her own devices, which he 'couldn't' allow, Lili would probably end up forcibly dominating him. However, if he turned around and dominated her instead, he would essentially be 'bullying' a small Amazoness into submission and, as she already recognized him as a suitable partner, the chances of her getting pregnant were almost 100%...</p><p>Suddenly, Vahn realized Lili's scheme and understood why she had originally asked permission to act selfishly. However, instead of being afraid of the consequences, Vahn smiled as the focus of both his bodies shifted almost completely to Lili. Before she could take things any further, Vahn rolled forward and reversed positions with Lili, pinning both of her arms to the bed by her wrists. Lili took several deep and excited breaths while wrapping her legs around him like a vice. Biting the bullet, Vahn decided to leave things to 'fate' and, after a much longer session than he had expected, ended up conquering his third Amazon...</p><p>(A/N: This is technically the end of Vahn and Lili's first time. I tried to avoid writing too many details, as you probably noticed, and instead tried pushing some character and plot development. The next few chapters have Naaza, and I'm wondering if I will write them today or tomorrow. If I can finish everything in one chapter, as Naaza has a lot less 'baggage' than Lili, I will post it today. If it takes 2, or more, I will publish them tomorrow. I don't want to leave you all standing on a big cliff xD...)</p><p>(A/N: Alternate Titles: 'Vahn Mason for President~!','RIP Lili, literally...','This is literally entrapment (o,...,o)!!!!')</p><p>https://bit.ly/2XBzAYu &lt;-(p.atreon link)</p><p>paypal.me/Einlion</p><p>Discord Invite: https://discord.gg/Jwa8PK</p></main><div class="link-group"><a class="btn" href="00718.html">Previous</a><a class="btn" href="index.html">Table of Contents</a><a class="btn" href="00720.html">Next</a></div></div><div id="readpos">0%</div></body></html>
