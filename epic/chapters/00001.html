Has shown that, if Vahn wished it, she would be more than willing to become one of his future 'partners' but, out of respect for Praxis, Vahn declined the offer.

Because of their association with the Guild, the Hermes Familia is rumored to be the one Familia that doesn't have to record the names of its members and their respective Levels. This has given them an air of mystery that makes many Familia avoid confrontation with the 'troublesome' god. Though the actual strength of the Familia isn't known, it is currently Ranked 6 in the top ten most influential Familia within Orario. The only god capable of freely moving his physical body between Heaven and the Mortal World without penalty.</p><p>Title: Messenger God, Free-Spirited Fool, Lecherous Idiot</p><p>Elemental Affinity: (none)</p><p>Divinity: Trade, Travel, Luck, Thieves(lesser)</p><p>Age: A LOT</p><p>Race: God</p><p>Hair Color: Blonde</p><p>Eye Color: Orange</p><p>Level: (?)</p><p>Status: Ally(?), Vahn's Shit List</p><p>-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p>Ganesha: Known as the 'God of the People' because of his unwavering dedication to providing entertainment to the masses.

Is aware that the Captain of his Familia, Shakti Varna, has had a crush on him since she was a young girl. However, as a result of a vow he made long ago, he has never been able to return her affections. He one day hopes she will find a suitable man that can take care of her, often teasing her by 'offering' her to any man he deems worthy of her.</p><p>Title: God of the People, Loudmouthed God</p><p>Elemental Affinity: (none)</p><p>Divinity: People, Fortune(lesser), Entertainment(lesser)</p><p>Age: A LOT</p><p>Race: God</p><p>Hair Color: Black</p><p>Eye Color: Red(?)</p><p>Level: (?)</p><p>Status: Ally, Friend, Kindred-Spirit</p><p>-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p>Kali: Goddess of the Kali Familia and former Goddess of Tiona and Tione Hiryute.

The reason for why she had taken up residence within the Dungeon is currently unknown but she is presently the primary antagonistic force facing the Alliance.

Curiously, though she is a goddess, none of the other gods seem to be aware of her existence...?</p><p>Title: (?)</p><p>Elemental Affinity: (none)</p><p>Divinity: (?)</p><p>Age: A LOT</p><p>Race: God</p><p>Hair Color: (?)</p><p>Eye Color: (?)</p><p>Level: (?)</p><p>Status: (?)</p><p>-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p>Miach: God of the Miach Familia, one of the five original Familias making up the Alliance. Miach is a kind, compassionate, and friendly god who always helps out those in need. Even though the members of his Familia often complain about it, he has a tendency to give away potions to new Adventurers to give them a better chance of survival in the Dungeon. Because of his handsome looks, the majority of his Familia members are females that 'fight' amongst themselves for his affection.</p><p>Title: Natural Giggolo, Patron God of Budding Adventurers</p><p>Elemental Affinity: (none)</p><p>Divinity: Alchemy, Family(lesser), People(lesser)</p><p>Age: A LOT</p><p>Race: God</p><p>Hair Color: Dark-Blue</p><p>Eye Color: Dark-Blue</p><p>Level: (?)</p><p>Status: Ally, Friend</p><p>-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p>Takemikazuchi: God of the Takemikazuchi Familia, one of the five original Familias making up the Alliance.

Because of the current trends in the world, most entertainment is associated with sex, drugs, and indulgence. As many of the members of her Familia are female, Terpsichore was always troubled by the fact that their clients would often try to take advantage of her members. Now that they had contracted themselves to Vahn, their Familia has now become the main staff of the Clubhouse, providing entertainment to the guests without having to compromise their integrity. As a result of his kindness, Terpsichore is quite fond of Vahn and enjoys drinking at his side on occasion.</p><p>Title: Illusory Goddess</p><p>Elemental Affinity: (none)</p><p>Divinity: Music, Dance, Wisdom(lesser), Entertainment(lesser)</p><p>Age: A LOT</p><p>Race: God</p><p>Hair Color: Silvery-Grey</p><p>Eye Color: Varying</p><p>Level: (?)</p><p>Status: Ally, Friend</p><p>-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p>[[Vahn's Children]]</p><p>-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p>Vana Mason: Firstborn of the Vanir and elder twin of Ina Mason. Has a very free-spirited and lively personality that causes her to get into trouble on occasion.

Has a very calm and pure character with a bit of a clingy nature. Ever since the moment of her birth, Ina has always cared very deeply for her Papa and considers him the most important person in her life. Though she tries to act mature and let her other siblings spend time with her Papa, Ina still struggles to be away from him for long periods of time. Because of her nature, she has developed a 'princess-like' mentality and often behaves somewhat spoiled, though only around her Papa.</p><p>Title: Papa's Girl, Vahn's Little Princess</p><p>Elemental Affinity: Light(pure), Fire, Source(lesser)</p><p>Divinity: Crafts(?)</p><p>Age: 4 months (Approx 2 years physically)</p><p>Race: Vanir</p><p>Hair Color: Pale-Blonde</p><p>Eye Color: Pale-Blue</p><p>Level: (?)</p><p>Status: Daughter of Hephaestus, Clingy</p><p>Guardian: Celestial Winged Tiger, Kuu</p><p>-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p>Erika Mason: Third daughter of Vahn Mason and the first child born to Loki. Has possessed a remarkable intelligence since birth and has never cried. Though she is good at keeping them hidden, Erika is actually a very emotional girl that is prone to embarrassment. She tries to act more mature than she is and studies very hard so she can help ease the burdens of her Papa. Erika has a very peculiar relationship with most of the girls in the Manor because of her 'distant' personality, though she often associates with her Mother, Syr, Juno, Eina, and Chloe. Also, even though she would never admit it, Erika is very attached to her Papa and gets lonely whenever he isn't spending time with her.</p><p>Title: Prodigy</p><p>Elemental Affinity: Chaos, Fire, Darkness, Light, Source(lesser), Illusion(lesser)</p><p>Divinity: Chaos(?), Order(?), Wisdom(?)</p><p>Age: 4 months (Approx 3-4 years physically)</p><p>Race: Vanir</p><p>Hair Color: Red</p><p>Eye Color: Green</p><p>Level: (?)</p><p>Status: Daughter of Loki, Protege</p><p>Guardian: Doppelganger, Doppel</p><p>-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p>Meinya Mason: An adorable little cat girl and Vahn's first child with Arnya.

Though having no genetic association with its parents, Alex is treated very well by its parents, unlike how True Dragons are typically raised. Currently, without a gender, Alex spends most of its time within the Spirit-Time orb so that is can mature in a safe environment while also working hard to increase its own knowledge. Its dream is to one day be the strongest True Dragon in the world, standing above all except its Father, Vahn Mason.</p><p>Title: Little Scholar</p><p>Elemental Affinity: Time, Space, Darkness, Ice, Source(lesser), Fire(lesser)</p><p>Age: Approx 10 years old, Appears around 2-3 years old physically</p><p>Race: True Dragon</p><p>Hair Color: Emerald Green</p><p>Eye Color: Aquamarine</p><p>Level: Approx Level 3</p><p>Status: Vahn's child, Heir of the True Dragons</p><p>Guardian: (none)</p><p>-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p>Sakuya Mason: Vahn's youngest daughter and the firstborn child of Tsubaki.

It possesses powerful offensive and magical might but, while its scales are as durable as Adamantine, the large scar on its chest would allow almost anyone to defeat it if they landed a direct strike. However, this curse is exactly what makes Fafnir such a terrifying foe as it also grants it nearly perfect magic nullification. Only existences that are much stronger than it, in both power and Soul Tier, can even hope to break through this powerful defensive ability.</p><p>Titles: Tyrant Dragon, Nemesis of Mages</p><p>Elemental Affinity: Darkness(pure), Destruction(lesser), Lightning(lesser), Source(lesser)</p><p>Age: 15</p><p>Race: True Dragon</p><p>Hair Color: Onyx Black</p><p>Eye Color: Stark Blue</p><p>Level: 6</p><p>Status: Loyal Subordinate, Guardian</p><p>-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p>Khaos: The evolutionary form taken by a Wyvern that Vahn had subjugated within the Dungeon.

Being the youngest among the True Dragons surrounding Vahn, its pride has been hurt by the 'negligence' of its Master. Fortunately, things have started to change once Vahn realized this. Though it would never admit it, Khaos is very fond of flying around with its Master riding on its back, especially since it usually gets its scales cleaned afterwards.</p><p>Titles: Vana Loki</p><p>Elemental Affinity: Space, Time(lesser), Destruction(lesser), Chaos(lesser), Darkness(lesser)</p><p>Age: 9</p><p>Race: True Dragon</p><p>Hair Color: Crimson</p><p>Eye Color: Amethyst</p><p>Level: 5</p><p>Status: Loyal Subordinate, Tsundere</p><p>-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p>Fatina Pegasi: The evolutionary form taken by a variant Silver Unicorn that Vahn managed to meet within the Dungeon.

She is somewhat envious of the fact that her sister is better at making coffee than she is.</p><p>Title: (none)</p><p>Elemental Affinity: Water</p><p>Age: 19</p><p>Race: Human</p><p>Hair Color: Purple</p><p>Eye Color: Pale-Blue</p><p>Level: 1</p><p>Status: Respectful, Employee, Fan</p><p>-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p>Selena Tanner: A capable musician who has mastered a variety of instruments, her favorite being the Harp. Has a very elegant appearance and a soothing voice that has won her the favor of many, especially those that frequent the Clubhouse. More so than many of the other girls, Selena is somewhat infatuated with Vahn and wished her various appeals to him would one day prove effective. She doesn't admit it, but his casual demeanor and appreciative gaze have slightly hurt her pride. As a result, Selena spends nearly two hours in front of the mirror every day to fix her hair and makeup, hoping that Vahn would stop by and pay her his favor...</p><p>Title: Elegant Songmaiden</p><p>Elemental Affinity: Water(lesser), Fire(lesser)</p><p>Age: 22</p><p>Race: Human</p><p>Hair Color: Red</p><p>Eye Color: Blue</p><p>Level: 2</p><p>Status: Respectful, Employee, Prospective Lover</p><p>-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p>Ki'Lani Ta'Lani: A member of the Terpsichore Familia that plays the lute and dances merry jigs that liven the atmosphere within the Clubhouse. With her exceptional hearing, Ki'Lani is very adept at listening in on other people's conversations. After learning about some of the rumors circulating around Vahn, Ki'Lani became very interested in him, though not to the extent of many of the other girls. She is just curious about his apparently 'godly' massage and petting skills, especially since he seemed very fond of 'exotic' girls. Knowing she was one of the first Rabbit Humes he interacted with, Ki'Lani often thinks about the day he might ask to pet her ears and tail.</p><p>Title: (none)</p><p>Elemental Affinity: Wind, Wood(lesser)</p><p>Age: 18</p><p>Race: Rabbit Hume</p><p>Hair Color: Brown</p><p>Eye Color: Pale-Orange</p><p>Level: 1</p><p>Status: Respectful, Employee, Interested</p><p>-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p>Renka Silverclaw: A former Adventurer to joined the Terpsichore Familia after the death of many of her former companions. After leaving her Familia, she was scouted by Terpsichore after the latter found her depressed and starving near the outskirts of the Entertainment District. With her lithe figure and limber body, Renka is very popular among guests for her tantalizing dance moves. Unfortunately for them, Renka has expressed a great deal of interest in Vahn after learning about everything he has done to help other people. Her goal in life is to make people smile and save as many people as she can from the same type of tragedy she once experienced.</p><p>Title: Ashen-Haired</p><p>Elemental Affinity: Light, Earth(lesser), Fire(lesser)</p><p>Age: 20</p><p>Race: Weretiger</p><p>Hair Color: Ashen-Grey</p><p>Eye Color: Pale-Purple</p><p>Level: 4</p><p>Status: Respectful, Employee, Eager</p><p>-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p>Rune Lice: A former slave that managed to escape to Orario with her parents several years prior. After losing both parents, Rune ended up as a street orphan that was picked up by Terpsichore because of her unique hair and eye color. After joining the Familia, Rune worked hard to learn how to play instruments and act as a backup singer to the more capable members of her Familia. A shy and bashful girl by nature, she often ends up embarrassing herself whenever Vahn shows up at the Clubhouse. She has heard about how strong Lili is and, being a Pallum herself, wonders if Vahn might one day help her become just as strong as the hero she looks up to.</p><p>Title: (none)</p><p>Elemental Affinity: Wind, Water(lesser)</p><p>Age: 16</p><p>Race: Pallum</p><p>Hair Color: Light-Pink</p><p>Eye Color: Wine-Red</p><p>Level: 1</p><p>Status: Respectful, Employee, Lili's Fan, Vahn's Admirer</p><p>-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p>(A/N: If you made it this far, I'm proud of you xD. There will be an AUX chapter about the LEGEND organization in the future.
