<p>While engaging in conversation with Touko back in her cottage, Vahn was also back in his workshop alongside Da Vinci and Sophia, the latter of whom was currently working on an airtight suit as she had recently taken an interest in outer space.</p><p>Having succeeded in his prank, Vahn pulled out a small black orb from his Inventory, a smile on his face as he explained, "Your [Battle Sphere] ended up working perfectly. Touka didn't even realize she was inside a [Space-Time Orb] at all."</p><p>Rather than an illusion, the trick Vahn used against Touko merely involved using a modified [Space-Time Orb], one which had a much larger radius. It was able to pull everyone within a certain distance into a near-perfect replica of the surrounding space, making it nearly impossible to ascertain what had happened. This was something he and Da Vinci had worked on together and, in many ways, it could be compared to a portable [Reality Marble].</p><p>Hearing Vahn's tone, Da Vinci gave him a knowing look before saying, "Your bad habit always comes to the surface when you are stressed out. Make sure you don't tease her too much. Cold women like that are weak to men who are capable of peeling away their defenses."</p><p>Though he didn't ignore her advice, Vahn shrugged in response to Da Vinci's words, explaining, "I'm pretty sure she is aware of Aoko's intentions. She tried to seduce me with one of her Puppets so it was a good opportunity to tease her a bit. Don't worry, I'm not in a particular hurry to increase the number of women that need my attention..."</p><p>Toward the end of his words, Vahn sent Da Vinci a wink, earning a light chuckle from her before she turned back to her current project. This was the same as her telling him, 'you can leave now' so, after checking in on Sophia's progress, Vahn did just that. He had already been in the Workshop for a few hours and, while his presence wasn't that much of a distraction, Da Vinci had a lot of active projects that required her attention. Since most of these were the direct result of his requests, Vahn knew it was best to give her space to work.</p><p>---</p><p>With the usual trio following his primary vessel around, Vahn decided to make good on his earlier promise, choosing the Menagerie as his destination. Unfortunately, just as he sent his intent to the room in question, he noticed that Aoko had stopped by with Fenrir. This complicated matters a bit so, after a few moments of contemplation, Vahn took a deep breath before releasing a long sigh as he chose the [Training Orb] as his next destination. He was curious about Scáthach's new apprentice and, as he had the time to do so, he decided to make some headway on her challenges.</p><p>After dragging his feet over to the [Training Orb], Vahn entered into the cold interior to find a small house a few dozen meters from the entrance. He didn't even have time to probe it with his senses, however, when Scáthach appeared like a blur at his side, asking, "What are your intentions, Master?"</p><p>Though Scáthach could easily guess Vahn's purpose for visiting at this time, she still made a point of giving him the option. He was the type that worked harder when he said he would do something so, while he may have arrived with the intention to work hard, having him express his intention openly ensured he would work even harder.</p><p>Vahn was, of course, perfectly aware of Scáthach's intentions but, as she was his Shishou, he couldn't really foot around the issue. Rather, if he tried to do so, a severe training regimen would await him in the near future, something he could handle but almost instinctually feared. Thus, in response to her question, he brought his mind to a state of focus before confidently stating, "I am here to complete one of your challenges. The world may be in disorder but that doesn't mean I can ignore my other duties, does it?"</p><p>With a curt nod of her head, the Caster version of Scáthach appeared and, before Vahn could change his mind and inquire about her new apprentice, he was transported towards the challenge grounds. He had already completed the task of pulling the statue, increasing his physical parameters by a truly monstrous amount, so his next challenge was one that directly tested his willpower and focus. This was achieved by having him sit in a lotus position as hundreds of needle-like barbs hovered a single millimeter away from his skin...</p><p>Any slight movement would cause the barbs to prick Vahn's skin and, as a result, he would be wracked with intense pain. To ensure he couldn't adapt to the pain, each barb had a unique curse placed on them and, to prevent him from simply 'shutting down', some of the barbs would move to stab into his skin at random intervals, requiring him to muster an immediate counter to the effect if he wanted to avoid triggering a chain-reaction.</p><p>While each of these variables made the challenge difficult, the straw that broke the camel's back was the fact that Scáthach herself would tease and taunt him. She would, at times, perform highly skilled stripteases while, at others, she would ask very difficult questions she knew he couldn't really ignore. This often related to his true feelings, various troubles he was currently facing, and sometimes even involved existential conundrums that related to concepts of eternity and loss...</p><p>This time around, Scáthach seemed to have realized why he had chosen to come for training so, in order to take advantage of his current state, her purple garb seemed to dissolve, taking on the form of an ornate, slightly transparent, bikini. She then sat in front of him, her legs forming an m-shape as a seductive glimmer reflected in her maroon-red eyes. At the same time, the barbs aiming at various pressure points and meridians began to vibrate slightly, masking their movements so that he would not be able to discern which was moving until it had already pricked his skin...</p><p>---</p><p>Vahn had been enjoying Touko's tense state but, after his training with Scáthach began, he was no longer in the mood to tease others. His current challenge required a lot of focus so it became a lot harder to engage others in a proactive manner. Since he didn't want to show any weakness in front of Aoko's sister, Vahn ultimately ended up bringing an end to the discussion. This resulted in Touko herself breathing a sigh of relief as, after what she had experienced, her mind had been racing to try and make sense of what happened...</p><p>After parting with Touko, who politely escorted him to the door, Vahn turned his eyes skyward and said, "I'm going to go meditate for a bit. Wait for me back in the Menagerie, okay? I'll be there in a few hours..."</p><p>With that said, Vahn teleported atop the back of Leviathan but, rather than meditate, he plopped onto his back and just shut off his senses completely. The frigid air and high winds were calming so, while his training with Scáthach was difficult, in many ways, he at least had a way to passively calm himself down. He had already learned the futility of trying to enter a meditative state during this particular challenge so it was better to just embrace the feeling of nothingness that he had become intimately familiar with.</p><p>---</p><p>Around the same time that Vahn was being tormented by Scáthach, Zelretch was making good on his previous words. Almost immediately after his parting with Vahn, he explained the situation to the fatigued Solon before teleporting to the top of Mount Chimborazo, the geological location that was the closest point to the moon. Here, space was twisted in the extreme, to the point that much of the mountain's peak was filled with pockets of vacuum that would rend apart the flesh of anyone who foolishly ventured too close.</p><p>Rather than show any concern for the twisting of space, Zelrech lifted his cane so that the top was aiming towards a specific point in space. Then, after more than half the cane had vanished into the void, he turned it in much the same was as a key.</p><p>Immediately after Zelretch unlocked the surrounding space, a massive set of stone doors appeared. They slowly opened, revealing a cold and desolate space that, on the periphery, appeared to be the night sky. Leading from the edge of the gateway, a set of pale white steps led into this seemingly endless starry void while, at the end of the pathway, a massive castle floated within the void while, above it, a miniature crimson moon served as the only other landmark within view.</p><p>Seeing the familiar sight once again, Zelretch released a tired sigh, one filled with emotions such as remorse and self-admonition. The cane in his hand suddenly felt heavier than before and, with each step that brought him closer to the castle, Zelretch imagined he was aging by several decades. This place represented one of his only true regrets in life as, due to his unwillingness to act, an innocent soul had been forced to undergo unimaginable suffering...</p><p>Though it felt like thousands of years had passed, Zelretch soon found himself at the entrance to the castle. The massive metal gates had already opened so, without further hesitation, he made his way into the heart of the castle. There, a throne far too large for a human to sit upon existed, one which held an indescribably beautiful woman with golden hair. She was slouched over, her head hanging low, arms spread wide as dozens of chains bound her body, each a self-imposed restraint to keep her immeasurable power in check.</p><p>Further adding to the tragedy of the scene, the woman seemed to be wearing a gown that was not all that dissimilar to a wedding dress. It was a pristine white gown trimmed with gold that gave the bound woman an appearance similar to a princess. This was a stark contrast to the dark silver chains that bound her body, each flickering with divine light, the purpose of which was to siphon away the woman's power, spewing it out into the surrounding void to make the seemingly infinite space even vaster...</p><p>Zelretch felt a discernible pain in his heart when he saw this sight but, before he could say anything, it felt like a stake was driven into his chest as the woman, without raising her head, asked, "Is it finally time...?"</p><p>Hearing this question, Zelretch couldn't help but hang his head, silence overtaking him for several minutes. Fortunately, a long life had prepared his mind better than most so, while an overwhelming amount of guilt threatened to devour him, he ultimately regained his calm and answered, "Arcueid...I came here today, not to use you as a weapon, but to liberate you from this prison. Many things have changed since you last walked the earth. Please, see with your own eyes how things have changed...it is not too late to reclaim the hope you lost..."</p><p>Though she kept her head down throughout Zelretch's dialogue, the golden-haired woman lifted her face when he fell silent. This revealed blood-red eyes through the golden locks, each glowing with a fierce light. It was enough to even make Zelretch's old bones ache as, while she was not as powerful as the original, the current Arcueid was nearly as powerful as Crimson Moon. In Vahn's terms, she would be a Tier 5 existence, one not all that dissimilar in power and purpose to Eva...</p><p>After staring directly at Zelretch for several minutes, neither moving a muscle, the woman let her head hang again as she asked, "How certain are you..." in a dull tone. What she didn't expect was for Zelretch to instantly state, "Absolutely." without any hesitation. Then, seemingly with the intent to convince her, he added, "The man I've found is from the 'Outside'...we have already confirmed it. He even has Alaya and the Spider on his side..."</p><p>This time, Arcueid couldn't easily ignore Zelretch's words as she knew just how powerful both of the aforementioned entities were. One of the reasons she had sealed herself away was in preparation for the coming battles against such entities as, without her power, humanity didn't really stand a chance. To hear Zelretch claim that the Spider had been subjugated was a ridiculous concept and, if not for his previous claim about the man in question hailing from the Outside, Arcueid wouldn't have been able to believe either claim was true.</p><p>Now, with her eyes glowing even more than before, Arcueid raised her head to look back at Zelretch, her tone both apprehensive and excited as she exclaimed, "Take me to him...!"</p><p>(A/N: Alternate Titles: 'The ultimate troll tool...','RIP Vahn.
