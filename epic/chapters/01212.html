<p>Despite her eagerness, Circe had been through quite a bit in the moments leading up to the loss of her virginity. As a result, even though Vahn 'cheated' by sending revitalizing energy into her body, it didn't take long before her body began cramping up and she was simply too mentally exhausted to continue. During that time, Circe had entrusted everything to Vahn and, knowing what she expected from him, he obliged by pushing her far beyond the limits of what he would have otherwise done. In her current state, she 'needed' to feel wanted and, just as he had during their first bathing session, Vahn completely surpassed her expectations.</p><p>In the end, Circe's eyes had glazed over and, in a completely absentminded and powerless state, she just laid sprawled out over the bed. Sweat covered her body from head to toe and, as Vahn had yet to perform the after-care, her lower body was tender and swollen as a seemingly endless flow of viscous white fluid drained from her insides. Her entire body was flush and, with her slim and delicate features, Vahn almost felt criminal regarding his treatment of his long-eared lover. However, seeing how she still managed a dazed smile, he knew she would recover and, so long as he prevented her from becoming addicted to the pleasure, she should be just fine with the passage of time.</p><p>Since he couldn't just leave her sprawled out like a stringless marionette, Vahn carefully wiped down Circe's body with warm towels while gently caressing her naked figure. This seemed to rile her up a bit but, as the soothing energy continued to invade her body, it wasn't long before her eyelids slowly drooped shut. Moments later, a rhythmic noise began to sound from Circe's nose as, despite the fact she had slept thirteen hours previously, physical and mental fatigue had once again claimed her.</p><p>Understanding he was 'trapped' in the room until Circe awoke again, Vahn had a wry yet gentle smile on his face as he finished cleaning her body. Then, using the fur cloak and feathered mantle that had been left with her, Vahn wrapped her body up so that she could stay warm. She seemed to be aware of his care as, despite being in a deep slumber, Circe managed a contented smile as she attempted to snuggle up at his side. Vahn used his advantageous position to stroke her head and run his fingers through her long pink hair, doing his best to comfort her as he turned his eyes toward the little voyeur who had been watching them.</p><p>Acting as if she was surprised he had 'noticed' her, even though she had not even tried to hide her actions, Medusa snapped her thighs shut while turning her golden eyes up at him with a pretense of shyness. Her tail, however, gave away that she was riled up quite a bit though, as it was slowly snaking across the bed behind her. Compared to the past, where it had only been 80cm long, Medusa had grown up a bit. Now, her tail had grown to 85cm in length and, every time she finished a molt, her height, and other physical proportions would change slightly. As a result, she was now around 142cm tall and, though the rest of her body hadn't really filled out all that much, her thin waist, toned butt, and slightly thick thighs had become more prominent than before.</p><p>With how close Circe and Medusa had become, Vahn knew the latter was considerably riled up after watching the former's loss of virginity. At this point, there was only a 5cm height difference between them, making the two very similar due to their petite appearance and complementary personalities. Thus, seeing someone similar to her engaging in such acts would have an obvious impact on the mischevious Gorgon, giving her a bit of expectation and courage. She also knew that he was stuck looking after Circe for a bit and, with the evening and normal rest period still open, it meant she could have him to herself for several hours.</p><p>Understanding what she must be thinking, Vahn had a serious yet affectionate expression on his face as he whispered, "If you believe you're ready, I won't refuse you, Medusa...just don't push yourself..." This remark seemed to give her even more courage than before as, after swallowing audibly, Medusa used her hair to propel her across the surface of the bed in a somewhat eerie yet seductive way. Compared to her height, her hair was around 160cm in length and, being able to manipulate each individual strand, it wasn't long before Medusa found her way to his side. Then, while gingerly wrapping her arms around him, she also used her hair to constrict his body a bit, something he had gotten used to over the last nine and a half months.</p><p>Despite what her actions would suggest, complete with Medusa flicking her abnormally long tongue against his chest while grinding against him with her hot and moist lower body, she ultimately answered, "I want to grow a bit more first...". Since she was already close to molting, even without using the [First Layer Molting Pill], Medusa felt it wouldn't be long before she was able to grow to around Circe's size.</p><p>Though each molt had somewhat diminishing returns, unless she was proactively trying to increase her strength, she was confident it wouldn't be long until she reached a point that her Master would be satisfied with. Even if he would set aside his inhibitions for her, she didn't want to push him to do anything and, if possible, Medusa actually wanted him to be the one to push her down. If not for this desire, she would have become one with him long ago as, at times, it was almost unbearable to see how happy Fenrir was when they were together.</p><p>Respecting Medusa's decision, even though her actions seemed to contradict her words, Vahn's smile became more pronounced as he leaned down and gave her a kiss. Her long tongue happily entwined with his while the constricting force of her hair more than doubled in intensity. At the same time, her long tail coiled around his leg and, though Circe might be a little upset when she awoke, the two remained bound together for several hours. Since having sex with Medusa was an ordeal that would take anywhere between ten-to-twelve hours, Vahn knew she was essentially 'practicing' for the moment when they were finally united. To that end, he performed his duty as well, tightly embracing her body in turn as he tolerated the startling heat and pulsation of her lower body pressed against his...</p><p>---</p><p>Though she was still extremely tired and lethargic, Circe awoke around nine hours later. Her eyelids slowly peeled open and, though she felt happy to see Vahn next to her, the presence of the silver-haired 'bundle' clinging to his body annoyed her more than a little. Still, as she had grown accustomed to the presence of Medusa, Circe did her best to calm the anxiety in her heart as she locked away with Vahn. This caused him to squeeze Medusa's pert buttocks, eliciting a slight moan from her lips as she came back to awareness.</p><p>As they had been overlapped for such a long period of time, she had become absentminded due to Vahn's caressing and the warmth of his body. The whole reason she wore a bodysuit was that her core temperature was usually very low and, if she didn't warm herself up in the bath or by laying with him, she would barely even be able to move around the castle due to the fact it was currently winter. This was the main reason she had yet to finish her own Quest as, while taking a hot bath was rather easy, she needed someone to accompany her if she took a bath in freezing temperatures. If not, she would literally pass out as her body entered a state of hibernation, one which she could only awaken from after being warmed up for several hours.</p><p>With Medusa obediently releasing his body, as she already understood his intentions, Vahn sat up in the bed before pulling Circe into his embrace once again. She offered no resistance against his actions, allowing him to move her into his lap as he loosely wrapped his arms around her and asked, "How are you feeling...?" This caused her to think back to the moments leading up to her losing consciousness, her face turning a rosy hue as a result. At the same time, her ears drooped adorably as she nuzzled into his chest and answered, "I'm fine...you were very gentle..." Though Vahn had pushed her body further than she even though possible, he had still treated her with a lot of care and concern the entire time. Circe even felt like she had become an extension of his body at one point, giving her the comfortable illusion that she would never be able to separate from him...</p><p>Holding her a little closer as she nuzzled into his chest, Vahn began to comb his finger through her hair as he muttered, "I'm glad...from now on, we are lovers...thank you for choosing me..." Since Hecate's actions had left a bit of an impact on him, there was a small feeling of guilt inside of Vahn's heart since he knew Circe had given up a lot just to be with him. Still, this wasn't enough to make him actually regret his decision as, when a woman truly dedicated herself to him, Vahn knew he would do whatever it took to make them happy. Now, he just needed to continue taking care of her and, though he may not be able to stay around her at all times, he would do his best to make the moments they are together meaningful...</p><p>In response to Vahn's words, Circe giggled in a sonorous tone as her ears waggled a bit. Then, looking up at him with slightly glazed golden eyes, she stated, "That's right...I chose you...be grateful~." After this, despite the fact she had only just awoken, Circe extended her hand into the small gap between their bodies, grabbing at Vahn's member with her delicate fingers. For a brief moment, he thought she wanted to continue from where they left off but, surprising him once more, Circe added, "I don't like sharing...but...until I'm confident I can tame this on my own...I may need a little help..." While saying this, Circe gave a glance toward Medusa, earning a snicker from the latter that both amused and annoyed her.</p><p>---</p><p>Though Circe would have obviously preferred to stay with him at all times, Vahn eventually had to part ways with the two by the end of the second rest period. Before that, he provided her with a lot of reading materials after explaining her current Status and encouraging her to complete her Quest. This ended up being a considerable boon as, even though Skills like [High-Speed Divine Words] had been erased from her mind, they still existed within her Skill Tree. Though it took a monstrous 30,000,000VE just to awaken the E-Rank version of the Skill, that made sense when considering that the current Circe had no knowledge concerning even basic Magecraft.</p><p>Fortunately, with 3,000,000VE banked after completing her Quest, Circe would be able to relearn most of the basics in a very short period of time. Getting E-Rank in all the Thaumaturgical fields would only require an investment of around 90,000VE. Rather than rely on such a thing, however, Circe was determined to reach a middling understanding in the fields she previously specialized in while using her Variable Experience on Skills she had an interest in but had never used. Her first action, however, was to invest 2,700,000VE into [Od Conversion:C] as, the faster her recovery, the more she could increase her reserves.</p><p>Unlike most Modern Magi, Circe was very aware of the fact that it took a torturous amount of effort if you truly wanted to reach the pinnacle of the arts. She had actually been a teacher to some of the most powerful Magi of her time, including her niece, Medea. Thus, as a matter of personal pride, Circe believed her talent and effort alone would be able to help her reach her previous potential. Then, following the teachings that Vahn had already made common amongst the residents of the castle, she would rise up to become a Goddess in her own right. This would be her way of vindicating herself and proving to Hecate that she had not made a mistake when choosing her lover...</p><p>As a result of her convictions, Circe ended up discarding one of her Quest rewards outright as, now that she had finally become one with the man she loved, there was no way she was going to punish herself just for a boost in strength. Since Vahn had been able to see the description and use of the items, he completely understood where she was coming from and, with the design of said item being rather 'precarious', it would be hard to find a use for it. After all, while a [Chastity Belt] was certainly useful in some situations, especially with the bonus effects it provided, the fact that it couldn't be removed until marriage made it hardly worth the trouble...</p><p>-----------------------------------------------------------------</p><p>[Chastity Belt]</p><p>Rank: Unique</p><p>Use: Greatly increased the replenishment of all energy sources. Inhibits arousal.</p><p>A belt formed from soft leather that has the intended purpose of preventing sexual intercourse and masturbation. In exchange for remaining chaste, this belt is said to greatly increase focus while also supporting mental, physical, and spiritual development.</p><p>Restriction: Cannot be removed until marriage.</p><p>[Pendant of the Moon's Promise]</p><p>Rank: Unique</p><p>Use: Bolsters the efficacy of all forms of training when performed under the light of the moon. Depending on the moon's cycle, the effects can be increased by as much as 200%. When the moon is absent from the night sky, however, the user's powers are completely sealed.</p><p>A crescent pendant that, despite its relative simplicity, contains a powerful enchantment. Legends say that the moon has always served as a mirror to reflect all things. As a result, training beneath its cold light allows the user to enter a focused state that greatly increases the efficacy of their training.</p><p>Restriction: Soulbound: [Circe]</p><p>-----------------------------------------------------------------</p><p>Fortunately, while the [Chastity Belt] seemed like a great inconvenience, the [Pendant of the Moon's Promise] was, despite the availability of better descriptives, promising. Using it, Circe would be able to make even faster progress and, as much of Fenrir's meditation and magical training were conducted at night, the two could train together. Even though they didn't get along all that well, Circe had come to respect and 'tolerate' Fenrir before so, now that she had most of her power stripped, the hierarchy in their relationship had been cemented.</p><p>Now, with few better teachers available, Circe had become something of a protege to Fenrir and, rather than learning the 'faulty' system taught in the Nasuverse, she was learning both Cultivation Techniques and Eva's Magic System. She was determined to reach Tier 4 through both Magic and, of all things, Cooking, so learning techniques to strengthen her Soul was a must. Since Fenrir and her both had an affinity for the Moon, there were few people more qualified to guide Circe as she began her climb towards the peak of Magic anew.</p><p>While this was going on, Vahn also continued focusing on his own efforts, passing much of the evening either focusing on his comprehension of the Laws, reforging [Laevateinn], or spending time with his children. He had currently entered a period where he was primarily focused on growth and, with most of the residents of the castle also dedicating a lot of time and effort to completing their Quests, things were always rather lively. The only 'problems' he was facing right now, other than preparing to hold Court after the next summoning, were meeting with Vivian, helping Mordred finish her Quest, and spending time with the increasingly violent Nobunaga.</p><p>At this point, Nobunaga was around two-months into her pregnancy and, understanding that she could get away with a lot, she had been 'bullying' him a bit. Still, Vahn tolerated her demands as, when she was finally pacified, he enjoyed the moments where they just quietly cuddled together as she allowed him to stroke her belly. Though she had barely started to show, there was a small bump around her navel that indicated the progress of her pregnancy. This actually caused her a fair amount of stress as, despite how confident she had been going into things, Nobunaga was very nervous about being a mother. It was because of this that she would randomly lash out at Vahn as, despite the fact that many of the other women in the castle spent time with her, she only really felt calm when he was around...</p><p>In this manner, Vahn passed his days proactively, his strength increasingly demonstrably, just like everyone else in the castle. Because of this period of growth, Vahn was rather excited about the future and, as if to add fuel to his already raging fire, yet another piece of good news reached his ears, albeit in a precarious manner. He had been making love to Rin, Ereshkigal, and Ishtar, as his relationship with the three girls had developed quite a bit after Sakura's birthday, when he was suddenly given a bombshell. Though all three girls seemed to have been aware of it, he noticed there were budding life forms within Rin's body that caused his heart to beat madly. Then, with Ereshkigal framing his face lovingly with her hands, she explained in an emotional tone, "We're pregnant..."</p><p>Though this news alone had caused Vahn to be over the moon with excitement, the rather unique situation of the three girls sent ripples throughout the entire castle. This was due to the fact that, while Rin was certainly pregnant, so too were Ereshkigal and Ishtar. Though this could have been misconstrued as them all being pregnant with the same child, the truth was considerably stranger as, rather than carrying one child, Rin was actually carrying three distinctly different children at the same time. One of the children was clearly the culmination of his and Rin's love while, having seen several examples, Vahn knew the other two were undoubtedly Vanir.</p><p>As a result of this peculiarity, Ereshkigal actually became the 'dominant' personality within Rin's body as, fearing for her child, as well as the other two, she had convinced Rin to give her primary control except when she was with Sakura. This was due to the fact that it could be very dangerous for Rin to bear two borderline Gods within her body as, just like how other Vanir were formed, the developing fetuses consumed a great deal of energy while also leeching off the Divinity of their parent. As Ishtar was actually troubled by the prospect of bearing a child, though she did have a few moments where the manifested, this left Ereshkigal with the responsibility of bringing the three to term.</p><p>Because of this unexpected development, Vahn's focus shifted away from his Quests and, though he was still training hard and carrying out his other duties, he spent a fair amount of time staying at Ereshkigal's and Nobunaga's side. Though he didn't ignore the other women he was involved with, obviously, his relationship with Ereshkigal had developed beyond his expectations. Similar to Gray, she would proactively seek him out and, so long as he wasn't busy training, this would end with him tending to her for a few hours. This usually only involved holding hands and talking but, as Ereshkigal had become rather emotional over the fact that she, a Goddess of Death, was able to bring life into the world, Vahn never turned her away...</p><p>(A/N: Alternate Titles: 'Medusa is very clingy...','I wonder how the [Chastity Belt] works on already married women...?','Circe must be annoyed xD...')</p><p>https://bit.ly/2XBzAYu &lt;-(p.atreon link)</p><p>paypal.me/Einlion</p><p>Discord Invite: https://discord.gg/mn5xMbE</p></main><div class="link-group"><a class="btn" href="01211.html">Previous</a><a class="btn" href="../index.html">Table of Contents</a><a class="btn" href="01213.html">Next</a></div></div><div class="right-icon theme"><input type="image" id="themeButton" src="https://i.imgur.com/PWAzExk.png" height="25"></div><div id="readpos">0%</div><script src="../js/theme.js"></script></body></html>
