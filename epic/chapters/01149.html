<p>While waiting for the crystalline solution sealing the bodies to slowly liquidize, Vahn decided to ask the most pressing question on his mind, turning to Da Vinci to inquire, "How exactly were you able to make three bodies in such a short period of time?" Though he had certainly given her enough materials to form a few homunculi, Da Vinci herself had said they were fundamentally different. He knew she was capable of doing many inexplicable things but, even knowing she had something like the [Soul Anchor: EX] Magic, this was slightly outside of his expectations. The only evidence he needed to know they were abnormal was, much like Da Vinci's current body, Vahn was unable to discern anything from the three bodies she had created.</p><p>As she had already expected Vahn to ask such a question, Da Vinci gave him a teasing look as she reminded, "If you want to learn the secrets of my bodies, you'll have to discover them on your own. What I can tell you, however, is that these are Conceptual Vessels, a Manifestation of Ideals that have been given physical form. In life, I had no such thing as a Noble Phantasm yet, now that I have been formed as the Mona Lisa, I have a unique ability that allows me to manifest my Omnipotence. By supplying nothing more than Magical Energy, my Noble Phantasm is able to instantaneously analyze a target before changing into a form that perfectly counters their existence. I can even break apart other Noble Phantasms without having to make any effort...ufufufu~."</p><p>Since Vahn only seemed more confused by her words, Da Vinci issued a sonorous giggle before adding, "These bodies function on a similar principle to Spirits such as Ghosts, Faeries, and Demons. Instead of being the amalgamation of a group of people, however, the forms of the Mona Lisa rely solely on my own pursuit of 'Idealized Beauty'. By providing pure Magical Energy in a form infinitely close to Ether itself, it is possible to actualize concepts and manifest them in the physical world. To make it easier to understand, you can consider your inability to grasp the true nature of this body as another way my own beliefs had manifested. Though beauty is an entirely subjective concept, the Mona Lisa represented what idealized beauty was to me, something only I was able to understand according to a very strict set of principles. With that being the case, you would never be able to comprehend the structure of this body as it uses a set of logic that is entirely 'alien' to you..."</p><p>Hearing Da Vinci's explanation, Vahn was still more than a little lost, even though he also had a loose understanding of what she was trying to convey. After all, his own body functioned on a similar set of principles as, even though he had taken physical form, he was irrefutably an entity comprised of Source Energy. In fact, all forms of matter were actually just a complex arrangement of particles that were constrained by a series of Laws to be given physical form. He also knew the reference she had made to Ghosts as, even though most people considered them to be fictional existences, the failure of Science to prove this left the lingering thought in the minds of people all of the world that they 'might' exist. As a result, Ghosts were a very real thing, just like Cath Palug, Angra Mainyu, and even Alaya herself. They were all the manifestation of concepts given sentience by a set of beliefs that, so long as a single person acknowledged the principle that governed them, guaranteed they would exist into perpetuity...</p><p>With the first tank drained, the most mature version of Da Vinci was supported by a series of padded mechanical arms that lowered her into a hunched-over position. Though there was a chance his crest would have no effect on them, Vahn didn't think it would be an issue since, even if she wasn't using them, he knew these bodies were still a part of Da Vinci. They may be Conceptual Vessels, but they were still given form as a result of her singular belief in the 'Idealized Beauty' while the [Soul Anchor] quite literally anchored them to existence. Though she had used the strange crystalline substance to put them in stasis prior to his arrival, Vahn suspected they wouldn't even degrade so long as they were properly cared for.</p><p>While observing Vahn form his Familia Crest, making sure to analyze every step of the process, Da Vinci also explained of her own volition, "These three bodies each represent a different approach towards the same concept. I have named this one after my previous work, Benois Madonna, using my analysis of Uesugi Kenshin and Rani Lakshmibai as a template. My goal was to create a body that was compatible with Divine Energy, even without having what you call a Divine Soul. Unfortunately, it does not seem possible to borrow the power of a God without their permission. Still, I believe I had some small success since this body still uses Divine Energy as a power source instead of Magical Energy."</p><p>-----------------------------------------------------------------</p><p>[Status]</p><p>Name: [Benois Madonna]</p><p>Age: 17 days (Ageless)</p><p>Race: Human</p><p>Strength: 5E</p><p>Endurance: 14D</p><p>Agility: 24C</p><p>Magical Power: 50A+</p><p>Good Luck: 19D</p><p>Soul Tier: (-)</p><p>Circuit Quality: EX</p><p>Noble Phantasm: (-)</p><p>Origin: (-)</p><p>Skills: [Mind Workshop:S], [Eidetic Memory:S], [Parallel Thinking:B], [Golden Rule:B], [False Divine Core:C], [Blasphemer:B]</p><p>Magic: (-)</p><p>Magecraft: (-)</p><p>[False Divine Core]</p><p>Rank: C</p><p>Use: Grants the user [Divinity] at the same rank as this skill but triples the amount of damage taken from both Divine and Anti-Divine attacks.</p><p>[Blasphemer]</p><p>Rank: B</p><p>Use: Decreases luck by two grades.</p><p>-----------------------------------------------------------------</p><p>When she saw the parameters and Skills of her Benois Madonna, Da Vinci snorted through her nose before commenting, "How petty. Now I feel even more determined to make a body that can emulate a God's." After these words left her lips, Da Vinci adopted a thoughtful expression while, right before Vahn's eyes, he watched as the body being supported by the mechanical arms simply dissipated into particles of mana that were absorbed by the holes in the bottom of the container. Though he had seen similar sights during his own experiments in the past, it was a little unnerving to see the body of another person vanish right in front of him. However, as it wouldn't make any sense for him to try and insist Da Vinci keep every Conceptual Vessel she makes, there wasn't anything he could about it.</p><p>Since she was able to read him very easily, Da Vinci noticed Vahn's discomfort even while she had been thinking about other things. Then, after palming her fist, she decided to tease him a bit by asking, "Did you want me to let you research that body? Do not worry, Vahn, as I can make any number of such forms in the future. Even if you get carried away with them, I don't mind what you decide to do. I was planning on making a version to help you train your Petting Laws in the future so let me know if there is a particular version you are fond of~."</p><p>Though she was just playing with him, Vahn knew that Da Vinci was actually very serious about her words. Even when she was teasing people, it didn't seem as if she was capable of lying to others as, from her perspective, it was merely a waste of time and brainpower. The most effective forms of teasing were things grounded in truth which, if the circumstances allowed, could be made a reality with only a marginal amount of effort. Thus, even though it was more than a little uncanny, Vahn couldn't help considering the matter since, if he left it to Da Vinci, there was a good chance he could increase his understanding of Petting Laws even further, all while allowing her to collect data...</p><p>Seeing that Vahn was in a better mood than before, Da Vinci finished preparing her second body, allowing Vahn to inscribe his Familia Crest as she explained, "I have higher expectations for this body, as I used my analysis of Artoria Pendragon and Siegfried as a basis when creating it. After analyzing the True Dragon materials you gave me, I was able to create a body that should be able to rival the power of Artoria herself if the power is able to mature properly. The only downside is, while I believe the body itself is of a higher quality than my current form, there is a very real chance that the limbs could explode if improperly used. I've never been too fond of physical exertion so this form is more of a failsafe than something I would typically inhabit..."</p><p>-----------------------------------------------------------------</p><p>[Status]</p><p>Name: [Maiden of Dragon's Descent]</p><p>Age: 22 days (Ageless)</p><p>Race: Human, True Dragon(sealed)</p><p>Strength: 34B</p><p>Endurance: 37B</p><p>Agility: 28C</p><p>Magical Power: 50A+</p><p>Good Luck: 39B</p><p>Soul Tier: (-)</p><p>Circuit Quality: EX</p><p>Noble Phantasm: (-)</p><p>Origin: (-)</p><p>Skills: [Mind Workshop:S], [Eidetic Memory:S], [Parallel Thinking:B], [Golden Rule:A], [False Dragon's Heir:A], [Mana Burst:D]</p><p>Magic: (-)</p><p>Magecraft: (-)</p><p>[False Dragon's Heir]</p><p>Rank: A</p><p>Use: Allows the user to emulate the properties of a True Dragon due to possessing the heart, bones, blood, marrow, and essence of a True Dragon.

Going by her own admission, this wasn't even the limit of the body as, with a bit of training, it would become even stronger. The most surprising element was that, much like Artoria herself, the body looked rather petite and powerless yet, as if this was nothing more than an illusion, it held several tens of times the power of a normal human being. It was only a few parameters weaker than he was, a fact that made Vahn feel somewhat embarrassed as he watched Da Vinci reseal the body in the stasis container. Though she was tempted to change bodies, she had higher hopes for the third and final body she had made as, even though it was the 'smallest' of the group, it was the one she spent the most time on.</p><p>As Vahn waited for the furthest-left tank to drain out, he was still considering whether or not to ask Da Vinci to prepare an extra body he could conduct tests on. He could always just make one himself, using a similar method to how he had produced the vessels for everyone else, but Da Vinci would be able to build in all kinds of resistances that he could not emulate. His own body would be too easily manipulated due to his 'awareness' of it, something that couldn't be changed unless he bound a soul to the vessel to detach it from himself. The one thing he was absolutely certain of, especially while watching the little girl in the tank slowly be lowered to her knees, was that he would make sure the version she prepared for him was a mature form. Though the 144cm tall version of the Mona Lisa was only 3cm shorter than Circe, while having slightly more developed features, Vahn could imagine the deadpan stares the other girls would give him if they discovered he spent time in the workshop with the body of an 'unconscious' young girl to hone his Petting Laws...</p><p>Once again, while watching Vahn apply the Familia Crest, Da Vinci took it upon herself to explain, "I have the highest hopes for this body as I used the data I had collected from analyzing Circe, Fenrir, and Medusa. Though it looks a bit young, I am confident that it has the most potential of any of the other designs I had come up with. The best feature is that, due to my inability to comprehend the structure of two of the existences it is based on, there is an air of Mystery inherently attached to this body. At the same time, I believe it has the highest compatibility with you, even if not used for the purpose of sexual intercourse and reproduction. You have a weakness against young girls so I should be able to tease you and focus on my work more easily in the future~."</p><p>-----------------------------------------------------------------</p><p>[Status]</p><p>Name: [Sage Emperor's Bane]</p><p>Age: 29 days (Ageless)</p><p>Race: Human</p><p>Strength: 11D</p><p>Endurance: 14D</p><p>Agility: 38B</p><p>Magical Power: 50A++</p><p>Good Luck: 40A</p><p>Soul Tier: (-)</p><p>Circuit Quality: EX</p><p>Noble Phantasm: (-)</p><p>Origin: (-)</p><p>Skills: [Mind Workshop:S], [Eidetic Memory:S], [Parallel Thinking:B], [Golden Rule:EX], [Aura of the Protected:EX], [Fragrant Aroma:B]</p><p>Magic: (-)</p><p>Magecraft: (-)</p><p>[Aura of the Protected]</p><p>Rank: EX</p><p>Use: Compels those with a positive impression of the user to protect them, even at the risk of great physical harm to themselves.

Reduces the ability of opponents to focus on the user with malicious intentions.</p><p>-----------------------------------------------------------------</p><p>As he had been able to read the runes as he formed the Familia Crest, Vahn's own expression became a blank mask that caused Da Vinci to giggle at his side. The name of this body alone was enough to make him want to facepalm but it was the fact that it actually had the [Golden Rule:EX] skill that caused Vahn's brain to completely blank. He had actually avoided looking directly at the younger of the three bodies because, even in his periphery, it's presence was almost intimidating. It gave off a similar impression to Circe, making you want to look while also making even the thought of looking seem improper.</p><p>Given the fact it even had another ridiculous EX-Ranked skill, it was clear as crystal to see that Da Vinci had put a little 'too much' effort into its creation. He knew there was nothing he could do to stop her from teasing him incessantly in the future, especially when the Da Vinci he had known up until this point spontaneously sat down on the ground before laying down and closer her eyes. In the next moment, the younger body being supported by the padded arms twitched with the signs of life, eliciting a sigh from Vahn as he helped her stand. Fortunately, she had enough wherewithal to cover each of the three bodies with a flesh-tone set of silicone undergarments so he didn't have to worry too much about seeing something he would rather avoid having to worry about for the time being.</p><p>Feeling Da Vinci's soft, seemingly boneless fingers, combined with the strange magnetism her shoulder seemed to have when his hand touched it, Vahn knew the next sixty years were going to be extremely troublesome. The one thing he was grateful for was that Da Vinci herself seemed to have no intention of using this body for anything 'too' intimate. At the same time, it was clear that she had always expected this body to become her new vessel as, after steading herself, she gave Vahn a smile before walking over to a mechanical cube and placing her palm on a small terminal. The cube opened to reveal a strange mechanical device that Da Vinci attempted to heft onto her back with a bit of difficulty.</p><p>Due to Vahn's presence, her Strength was only that of a normal person but, once she had properly worn it, the device seemed to lose its weight as it began to glow with magical blue light. There was the sound of a mechanical whirring as, from within the cube, a set of two stylish gauntlets formed around her forearms while a set of massive mechanical arms attached themselves to her backpack. Then, as Da Vinci's hands moved around, the larger mechanical arms mirrored her movements as she quickly calibrated them while explaining, "I had a feeling that anything I made in an attempt to 'counter' your impossible existence would be of a much higher quality than normal. As these bodies are just Conceptual Vessels before my Soul inhabits them, they are able to carry my intentions and beliefs. Now that I've confirmed this, I'll be able to make a more powerful form in the future. Can you put that old body of mine into the stasis container for me~?"</p><p>While shaking his head in an exasperated manner, Vahn removed the gemstone necklace from Da Vinci's [Mona Lisa] before handing it over to the lingerie-clad young girl she now inhabited. As he placed her former body into the container, Da Vinci continued to calibrate the exoskeleton she had prepared to facilitate her smaller body, complete with a series of interchangeable arms, some of which seemed to be powered by nothing more than her thoughts. After she was finished trying out each component, Da Vinci settled on a pair of thin, multi-segmented, mechanical arms that would allow her to work with the same machine precision she required for her work. They were formed of black and gold metal, artistically designed to match many of Da Vinci's other masterpieces.</p><p>Now that she was wearing proper clothing, Vahn could finally look directly at Da Vinci's new body, now fit with royal blue goves and stocking that ran past her elbows and halfway up her thighs. The rest of her outfit consisted of a red dress that was lined with frills along the hem. Underneath were several layers of pristine white fabric that were equally as frilly which, combined with the sparrow-like doublet and frilled choker, gave her a youthful yet stylish appearance. Vahn never understood why she liked to have puffy fabric around her shoulders and upper arms but, as it made the outfit look strangely 'balanced', he couldn't really comment on it. Then, to complete her the entire outfit, Da Vinci looked at herself in a large mirror for a few moments before tying her hair up in a loose ponytail, using a black bow that she requisitioned from Vahn.</p><p>After she was satisfied with her appearance and the function of her assistant exoskeleton, Da Vinci turned her attention to Vahn before swaying her hips, making her dress spin back and forth a few times as she asked, "So, what do you think? Am I the most adorable young lady you've ever laid eyes on? Be honest, as I'll be able to tell if you're lying~." Since her features were still almost the exact same as the Mona Lisa's, albeit much more youthful, Vahn could only give a wry smile in response before surprising her slightly when he commented, "You are indeed adorable, but the title of most adorable will always belong to my daughter, Ina."</p><p>Hearing Vahn's words, on of Da Vinci's sub-processes imagined a young woman with platinum blond hair and striking blue eyes that could see the future. One of Vahn's most prominent memories was seeing her smile toward him for the very first time while each of his successive memories regarding her actually served as the stimulus for some of Da Vinci's own innovations. As a result, though she was slightly dissatisfied that Vahn claimed Ina was more adorable than she was, Da Vinci couldn't really fault him. Even her own views of beauty were biased so, unless she was willing to admit her own logic was wrong, Vahn's words were the 'truth', at least from his perspective.</p><p>With an understanding nod, Da Vinci didn't show any signs of being bothered as she smiled in a teasing manner and commented, "There are things I can get away with that your daughter would be admonished for. Observer~." As she said this, Da Vinci lifted up the edges of her dress, causing Vahn to roll his eyes as he asked, "Who was it that said that the 'mystery' of what lay beneath clothing was one of the most charming aspects of it...?" This caused Da Vinci to immediately giggle like a young girl as trotted over to his side and reminded, "I could take them off completely if you'd like? It would be rather inconvenient, but even this body is perfectly capable of bearing children. I'm certain you would be able to manage the delivery without any major issues, ufufufufu~."</p><p>As he had already expected Da Vinci to behave like this, Vahn wasn't flustered by her words as he reached out his hand to rub her head, explaining, "This form might provide you numerous benefits, but it also has a pretty drastic weakness...my skills are far more effective when I think the target is adorable." Though this wasn't 'entirely' true, Vahn wanted to experiment with the concept of trying to change the perception of the target. If Da Vinci believed his words were true, something she could loosely verify from his memories, it would become true. As Vahn himself chose to believe it, he could feel the peculiar energy of Petting Laws flow into Da Vinci's head as it spread a calming wave through her entire body.</p><p>After blinking a few times in surprise, Da Vinci smiled before pulling Vahn's hand away, seemingly undaunted as she teased, "Perhaps the body I prepare for you will look even younger? I can even give her a pair of fluffy ears and a tail, ufufufu~." This comment was enough for Vahn to concede defeat as he took in a deep breath with a 'warning' look in his eyes. Though this caused Da Vinci to giggle, she was also very aware that Vahn was serious and that she shouldn't take things too far. She did, however, intend to make a version of herself that was resistant to his Petting Laws since she was also curious about how far he could push the peculiar energy that was currently difficult to even analyze. If he could show its usefulness in a more cohesive manner, she might find a use for it herself in a future invention...</p><p>(A/N: Alternate Titles: 'Belief is a powerful thing','The Sage Emperor's Bane xD...','Vahn about to give Da Vinci a spanking...')</p><p>https://bit.ly/2XBzAYu &lt;-(p.atreon link)</p><p>paypal.me/Einlion</p><p>Discord Invite: https://discord.gg/mn5xMbE</p></main><div class="link-group"><a class="btn" href="01148.html">Previous</a><a class="btn" href="../index.html">Table of Contents</a><a class="btn" href="01150.html">Next</a></div></div><div id="readpos">0%</div></body></html>
