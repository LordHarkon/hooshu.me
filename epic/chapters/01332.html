<p>After suffering six hours of Scáthach's challenge, Vahn breathed a sigh of relief as, across from him, his demonic Shishou adorned her usual attire. At the same time, he sent a surge of his source energy outwards, shattering each of the needle-thick barbs while remarking, "If I had to guess the purpose of this challenge...you seem to be trying to curb my flirtatious habits...?"</p><p>Instead of refuting his words, Scáthach gave Vahn a side-long glance, silence persisting between them for several seconds before she answered, "It is perfectly normal for a capable man to keep multiple wives. You, however, take things too far. There is a vast disparity between the women you keep company. At this rate, there is bound to be conflict at some point. You may have uncommon proficiency in the bedroom but, given enough time, those with wavering loyalties will stray from your side."</p><p>As he had long prepared himself for that exact happening, Vahn gave an understanding nod in response to his Shishou's advice. However, while something would undoubtedly happen over the literal eternity he was expected to live, he still felt she was underestimating him. He may lack the capabilities now but, so long as he continued striving toward his ideal future, his aspirations and The Path would allow him to reach his goals. He just needed to remain focused and prevent any setbacks from adversely affecting him in any meaningful ways...</p><p>Rather than worry about his infinitely expanding harem, Vahn was more concerned about each individual relationship. This included his relationship with Scáthach and, after completing all of her challenges, he was determined to make her his. She seemed to be preparing for this as well as, while it was almost never discussed, virtually everyone in the castle had noticed her changes. Since her default personality was cold and emotionless, even small changes in her behavior were noticeable to people with the sensitivities and perception of Heroic Spirits.</p><p>Seeing the confidence in Vahn's eyes, Scáthach released a small sigh since she knew he hadn't taken her words to heart. She hadn't expected him to suddenly cut off the women in his life that had lesser value but, knowing she would eventually have to share him, it hurt her warrior's pride. If she had met Vahn during her era, anyone she didn't approve of would have been driven away as their presence ultimately threatened the status of her, her children, and Vahn himself...</p><p>Had the situation been different, Scáthach would have put more pressure on Vahn but, with his vice-like grip on the entire world, it likely didn't matter all that much. Still, she affirmed her own resolve so that, if any of the other women were to betray him, they would pay the price. While it may not matter to Vahn, Scáthach would never allow someone that once held his affections, and potentially had his children, to become the mistress of another. It was a slight to all of them, not just Vahn himself, so she would punish them appropriately.</p><p>Unaware of what his Shishou was thinking, Vahn stretched his body for a bit before saying, "I want to meet your new disciple. I trust your judgment but it will take more than a simple introduction to accept a past enemy into my home. Come, it is time I learn more about this 'Ciel' woman."</p><p>Hearing Vahn's words, Scáthach immediately teleported them both to the small Japanese-style hut that had been constructed. The Empire borrowed a lot of oriental designs in everything from its armor to the architecture of the Castle Town so it was often the go-to style when constructing new buildings. Vahn personally felt more comfortable in such traditional houses, primarily due to his time spent living together with Tsubaki, so it always brought a smile to his face when he saw the familiar tatami mats, the sound of wind chimes gently ringing in his ears...</p><p>Just as Vahn was beginning to relax, he was greeted by a somewhat unexpected sight, causing his brows to raise slightly as he looked toward Scáthach with a questioning look. She, however, completely ignored him and instead addressed the meditating woman in the middle of the room, saying, "Elesia, our Master has arrived. Greet him properly."</p><p>Ciel had actually wanted to open her eyes earlier but, as early as her first day inside the Training Orb, she had learned not to allow external stimuli to distract her. Scáthach wasn't kind to people who slacked off in their training and, in the hopes of having her wish granted, Ciel wasn't going to slack off for even a moment. Thus, until Scáthach gave her permission to stop training, she did her best to ignore the literal ocean of mana that Vahn represented in her perception...</p><p>Before Ciel could greet him properly, Vahn maintained his casual smile as he pulled out a thin cloth and guided it to wrap around her body. She had been wearing nothing but an extremely thin garment, one similar in structure to Scáthach's bodysuit. While it covered everything, the extremely thin fabric left very little to the imagination and, having been informed of Ciel's wish, Vahn felt it wasn't proper for him to see her in such a compromising state.</p><p>Having never expected Vahn to suddenly give her something to cover her body with, Ciel was at a momentary loss. When she saw Scáthach staring at her, however, she quickly recovered, bowing at a very low angle as she exclaimed, "Ciel greets His Majesty, the Sage Emperor!"</p><p>Though he didn't drop his casual smile, Vahn adopted a formal tone in response to Ciel's words, saying, "It is good to meet you as well, Ms. Ciel. I learned of your circumstances from Scáthach. As you have already made a vow, I intend to make good on her promise to you in the coming days. It is impossible to allow you to view the ritual directly but, when the time comes, you may stay in the nearby waiting area. I'm certain things will be a lot easier for our intrepid young friend if you are there to explain things for him."</p><p>As it had only been a few days since the start of her training, Ciel hadn't even thought to ask about the promise that had been made to her. She believed it would only be after she proved herself that her wish would be granted so, hearing Vahn's words, her eyes began to tremble as a layer of moisture covered them. She wanted to thank him for his grace but, every time she tried to vocalize her gratitude, the words got caught in her throat.</p><p>Seeing how Ciel was reacting, Vahn's expression softened a bit as he used his telekinesis to help her stand. Since she was tightly hugging the cloth he had given her, she looked especially frail and delicate, a testament to everything she had gone through to reach this point. This made him feel greater empathy for her and, while it was a little earlier than he intended, he decided to move up the next summoning by a few days. People like Ciel deserved a bit of happiness and, with how chaotic the world could become, each little bit of positivity could go a long way.</p><p>Deciding to make it a surprise, Vahn kept his changed plans to himself and, without requiring a response from Ciel, he just continued smiling as he said, "I have other matters to attend. Please, continue to do your best. Shishou can be a harsh mentor but, when it comes time for you to put your training to the test, you will learn the importance of her lessons."</p><p>Realizing that Vahn was about to leave, Ciel did her best to collect herself but, ultimately failing to do so, she decided to perform a kowtow instead. It was a little awkward to see a young woman lower herself in such a manner but, understanding she wanted to express something that words could not, Vahn gave a curt nod in response. Then, after making brief eye contact with Scáthach, he teleported out of the Training Orb. He had already kept the girls waiting long enough and, if he didn't show up soon, Circe would undoubtedly complain...</p><p>---</p><p>At the same time as his departure from the Training Orb, Vahn moved to a seated position atop Leviathan. He could deal with the girls without any major difficulties so, with a bit of free time on his hands, he decided to continue visiting the castle's newer residents. He still needed to check up on Lilith and, while she didn't really require much attention in her present state, he wanted to at least stop by to visit Tiamat for a short while. She had sealed herself away in a massive cacoon-like structure but, while it kept everyone else away, he could enter without any difficulties...</p><p>Before paying either of his intended targets a visit, Vahn first made a detour to the outside world, expanding his senses to the surroundings before ultimately teleporting to the Hanging Gardens. If he visited Lilith without first stopping by to spend some time with Semiramis, the latter would be in a sour mood for several days. In fact, when she first met Lilith, Semiramis had been more than a little upset as the presence of the Queen of Succubi made her feel threatened.</p><p>In order to pacify her concerns, Vahn whisked away Semiramis for a few hours, coaxing her until she had resumed her normal state. During that time, she had tried to have him promise to never sleep with Lilith but, as this was basically inevitable, Vahn talked her into a compromise. He would proactively try to set up Lilith with someone else in the near future but, regardless of how things turned out, he promised to make her his before pursuing the sensuous Succubi.</p><p>From Semiramis' perspective, this provided her a bit of leverage as it allowed her to refuse his advances, potentially driving a wedge between him and Lilith. This would ultimately prove futile, however, as Vahn wasn't really the type to be swayed by schemes and machinations. He might not force himself on Semiramis but, if she tried to get away with teasing him, the only person she had to blame for the outcome was herself. After all, her long ears and tsundere nature brought out the slightly sadistic side he had developed back in Danmachi and, while he wouldn't torment her, he would tease her into oblivion if given the chance...</p><p>Semiramis had learned this the hard way as, during one of her attempts to poison him, she mixed a very potent aphrodisiac into his meal while wearing a perfume enriched with pheromones. This ultimately had no effect on him but that didn't stop Vahn from taking advantage of the situation, surprising Semiramis as she momentarily believed her poison had taken effect. She immediately tried to toy with him only to realize that his sleeping dragon was fully functional, something the poison should have prevented.</p><p>Though he ultimately released her before taking things too far, Vahn had forced Semiramis to sit on his lap as he held her close and nibbled on her long ears. She struggled quite a bit but, even though they were in the Hanging Gardens, a place where she could spam S-Rank spells and freely teleport, she made no attempt to actually escape. Since there was no way she wasn't aware of her own capabilities, Vahn enjoyed teasing her for the better part of half an hour before she ultimately ran off to her room, slamming the door behind her...</p><p>Since then, his relationship with Semiramis had improved slightly but, from that moment onward, she pretty much refused to even visit Avalon. Instead, she made the Hanging Gardens her home and, as there had already been several attacks against the floating fortress, it now hovered in the Thermosphere, surrounded by an expansive Borealis. It was a truly breathtaking sight and, since he didn't want Semiramis to be too lonely, Vahn tried to visit when he had time...</p><p>(A/N: Alternate Titles: 'Scáthach is cold-blooded o_o...','Shiki is going to be so confused xD','The bane of long-eared females...!')</p><p>https://bit.ly/2XBzAYu &lt;-(p.atreon link)</p><p>paypal.me/Einlion</p><p>Discord Invite: https://discord.gg/Jwa8PKh</p></main><div class="link-group"><a class="btn" href="01331.html">Previous</a><a class="btn" href="../index.html">Table of Contents</a><a class="btn" href="01333.html">Next</a></div></div><div id="readpos">0%</div></body></html>
