<p>After nearly seven hours had passed, Vahn was hugging Tamamo from behind, her tail serving as a soft cushion between them as he continued to grind against her. She had tuckered herself out after a laughing fit that lasted more than twenty minutes, her body flushed with a ruddy hue that made her seem even more beautiful with a glistening layer of sweat.</p><p>While holding her body tightly, Vahn persistently bit, licked, and kissed around Tamamo's neck, eliciting gasps and moans from the dazed kitsune as she absentmindedly licked his fingers. This had been going on for a while, but, as he was enjoying the startlingly hot sensation and pleasant tightness that clung to his member, Vahn didn't mind continuing. This wasn't because due to his selfishness, rather, every time he tried to extricate himself from her rhythmically pulsating depths, Tamamo would adopt a rather pitiable expression before pleading that he continue.</p><p>Though she didn't mind dutifully servicing her husband, Tamamo had always wanted a man that could keep up with her. Vahn, however, greatly exceeded her expectations, pushing her beyond the limits of pleasure. She felt like they had become one person, their hearts and bodies linked in a way she had never thought possible. Thus, whenever he tried to pull away from her, she would feel panicky and frightened, fearing the good feelings would never return...</p><p>Vahn could sense Tamamo's fear, so, in between leaving hickeys on her neck, he would whisper kind words to pacify and coax her. He would also gently nibble around the base and points of her ears, knowing how sensitive they could be through personal experience.</p><p>Unfortunately, all good things eventually came to an end, so, after hugging her frail-seeming yet incredibly durable body, stretching her insides beyond their natural limits, he released another large volume of potent semen. This vital fluid contained an incredible amount of Source Energy, so, due to her nature as a Divine Spirit, Tamamo would feel like her own energy was overflowing. This caused her toes to curl as her body attempted to arch, prevented by how firmly he held her in his embrace.</p><p>Though it was somewhat painful, Vahn allowed Tamamo's sharper-than-normal teeth to sink into his fingers. This was to prevent her from choking or swallowing her own tongue, so, while it was a little painful, it was almost negligible compared to what he had experienced in the past. Illya had, at times, taken large chunks out of his body, so, compared to how extreme things could get, this first encounter with Tamamo had been relatively tame...</p><p>After attempting to extricate himself once again, Tamamo seemed to return to her senses in an instant, whining, "Nooo..." in a voice that seemed to be on the verge of sobbing. This made Vahn feel a little guilty, but, repeating the words he had said to her countless times, he said, "I promise, there will be more chances for us to be together in the future. It breaks my heart to see you like this...won't you give me a smile...?"</p><p>Rather than smile, Tamamo's face formed into a pouting expression as she buried her face into a nearby pillow. This made Vahn feel a little awkward, his face forming a wry smile as he sat next to her and gently stroked her hair, ears, and tail. He knew she wasn't really mad, rather, he seemed to have awakened a selfish aspect of her character. Since he could see the Flow of Fate, he knew she would bounce back the moment he moved to leave the room, returning to her bubbly and lascivious personality...</p><p>While petting Tamamo's body, Vahn looked at what remained of the bed, now a destroyed mess of fabric and foamy mesh. Since this bed had cost 85,000 Origin Points, it felt like a bit of a waste, but, as he quite enjoyed his time together with the vulpine women, Vahn didn't mind it. Rather, it was strangely fun to destroy the surroundings whenever he was pleasuring his women, elevating the experience far beyond simple love-making...</p><p>For a brief moment, Vahn's mind slipped to the 'devastating' consequences of his intercourse with Arcueid, reminding him that she, and everyone else, was waiting for his return. With this in mind, he lightly spanked Tamamo's pert white posterior, saying, "We'll take a quick bath before meeting with Artoria. I still have important matters to attend, but, before that, I'd like to introduce you to the rest of our family."</p><p>As if her 'pouting' from before had been nothing more than an illusion, Tamamo's ears perked up in response to Vahn's words. She quickly moved to a seated position, a vibrant smile on her face as she answered, "Certainly, Ten'nō-sama. I'll wash your back for you~!"</p><p>Though he had gone easier on her in the latter half, Vahn couldn't help but smile in amusement after seeing how quickly Tamamo 'recovered'. He could see her body was still trembling in the echoes of a persistent pleasure, but, when it came to doing her 'duty', Tamamo was surprisingly diligent. If it was for the person she had dedicated herself to, Vahn imagined there was very little she wouldn't do to satisfy their needs...</p><p>--------------------------------------------</p><p>Name: [Tamamo-no-Mae], [Daji], [Kayō], [Bao Si], [Mikotto]</p><p>Age: 3,091, [Ageless]</p><p>Race: Nine-Tailed Divine Fox Spirit, Goddess(sealed)</p><p>Loyalty: (-), [Eternal Loyalty(conditional)]</p><p>Soul Strength: 5(sealed)</p><p>Karma: 114,093,552</p><p>State: [Active]</p><p>Skills: [Vessel of the Sun Goddess:Innate:EX(sealed)], [Tamamo-no-Mae:Innate:EX(-)], [Child of Destiny:Innate:A], [Witchcraft:Innate: EX(SS)], [Songmaiden of Moonlight:Innate:C], [Shapeshift: A], [Fox's Wedding: EX], [Curses: EX], [Divinity: A], [Bridal Training: EX], [Sexual Techniques: S], [Dancing: A], [Singing: A], [Service: A], [Cooking: A], [Court Etiquette: B], [Territory Creation: C]</p><p>--------------------------------------------</p><p>From the moment he had accepted Tamamo as his bride, her Loyalty value had defaulted to the 'Eternal Loyalty' parameter. This allowed him to understand a bit of her true nature, and, though there would undoubtedly be some drama, he didn't have to worry about her going out of control. Rather, with [Bridal Training: EX], she seemed to have the ability to influence other women around her, turning them into suitable, service-oriented, brides...</p><p>So long as he never divorced her, Tamamo would continue to dutifully serve in the capacity of what she believed to be the 'perfect wife'. If she could be convinced that getting along with the others was necessary, her perspective would undoubtedly shift to reflect this. Now that he had given her a proper incentive, Vahn just needed to introduce her to everyone before leaving her in the care of the Menagerie. Under the guidance of girls like Fenrir and Circe, it was only a matter of time before adapted to her new environment, prospering among the rest of his women.</p><p>With this thought in mind, Vahn enjoyed another long bath with Tamamo, allowing her to wash his back using her own body and a thin towel. Then, despite her 'protests', he forced her to allow him to wash her in turn, paying special attention to the areas around her tail, ears, and inner thighs. He had done a number on her during their seven-hour session, so, while her constitution would allow her to recover quickly, Vahn accelerated the process using his [Hands of Nirvana].</p><p>Tamamo enjoyed being pampered quite a bit, so, even if she enjoyed servicing others more, she had no complaints about her new husband's treatment. Rather, her expression made it appear as if she were slightly drunk, complete with hazy eyes, ruddy cheeks, and a somewhat silly smile. She also giggled whenever he washed around her sensitive bits, fluffy and pleasant feelings welling in her chest and spreading through the rest of her body...</p><p>By the time the bath had come to an end, nearly forty minutes had passed. Vahn then spent more than half-an-hour brushing Tamamo's hair and tail before helping her pick out a brand new set of lingerie and a new kimono. She hadn't been too keen on the idea of lingerie, but, after trying on a few silken garments, finding they accented her beauty quite a bit, she ended up picking a pair of black lace panties and a matching brassiere. As for her kimono, she was able to manifest a highly revealing outfit that, in a way, served as her Divine Raiment.</p><p>Vahn felt Tamamo's outfit was a little too revealing, especially with how much cleavage it showed off, but, as they were the clothes she was most comfortable in, he wasn't going to force her. It was still tamer than some of the outfits worn by Fenrir, Okita, Circe, Nobunaga, and Mordred, so, there wasn't much he could say. Rather, he was more worried about the fact that Isanna and Naavi both enjoyed wearing their Divine Raiments, outfits far more revealing than most swimwear...</p><p>After going through the process of helping each other dress, ending with Vahn wearing his usual outfit, earning him a bit of praise from Tamamo, even though she also remarked that he looked better in more traditional wear. He knew she was talking about the yukata he was wearing earlier, but, while he certainly borrowed a lot of eastern inspiration, Vahn defaulted to more western-style clothes due to his experiences in Danmachi. This included trousers, tunic, sash, and a belt that was more for appearances than functionality. He would even wear his gauntlets and greaves at times, albeit only when he was trying to appear more intimidating.</p><p>Vahn liked to wear stylish and 'cool' clothing, but, more so than anything else, he just liked to be comfortable. It was for this reason that he didn't begrudge others for their choice in clothing, so long as they took into consideration things like time, place, and occasion. While it was ultimately the fault of those who gawked and made rude remarks, he knew the blame wasn't solely on the offender when one party wore highly revealing, skin-tight, clothing. Beauty was something to be admired, so, if provided with the opportunity, very few people would pass on the opportunity to appreciate it...</p><p>---</p><p>With Tamamo in tow, Vahn teleported to one of the larger banquet halls near the Knight's Training Field. This was colloquially known as the 'Soldier's Mess', and, though they didn't exactly need to eat, thanks in large part to the Ouroboros Seal, there were a few hundred Einzbern Homunculi enjoying a meal together. They, like Vahn, enjoyed the act of social eating, and, considering the quality and flavor of the foods, it helped to improve morale quite a bit.</p><p>Upon seeing an ocean of beautiful women immediately turn their eyes toward her husband, both fervor and adulation visible in their gazes, Tamamo's expression became one of abject panic. This elicited a light chuckle from Vahn, understanding what she was thinking. Her fears weren't entirely unfounded, especially due to the compulsion of his Divinity, but Vahn had built up a tolerance to the frighteningly loyal women.</p><p>Vahn knew that if he ended up sleeping with even a single Homunculus, it would be like rolling a snowball down a freshly powdered mountain. He was the type to make excuses and proactively seek a justification for his actions, so, if he ended up crossing that line, there would be no way of turning back. He would feel guilty about refusing the affections of the other Homunculi, so, after a single slip-up, his harem would undoubtedly grow from double, to quadruple, digits...</p><p>Though it would take a while, Vahn knew many of the Homunculi would eventually begin to seek companionship elsewhere. Many of the former Knights of the Round Table had already begun to court a few, the only exceptions being Lancelot and Galahad. The former still blamed himself for his past life's failings, so, for the time being, he wasn't really looking for love. As for Galahad, that was another issue in and of itself, as, with the ability to see the Flow of Fate, Vahn had seen quite a number of timelines where he and Sakura end up together. He had even looked far into the future once, finding Sakura training what appeared to be a younger version of herself, all while wearing the armor of an Imperial Knight...</p><p>(A/N: Alternate Titles: 'How to spoil your kitsune-waifu','Another Tier 5!?','The downside to being able to peer into the future...')</p><p>(A/N: For those wondering how Tamamo can be considered Tier 5, just consider the fact that, at her maximum potential, she is even able to destroy the Moon Cell's Core in a single kick. She can even defeat Velber 02 without much difficulty, making her stronger than even EX-Rank existences such as the Olympian Gods.)</p><p>https://bit.ly/2XBzAYu &lt;-(p.atreon link)</p><p>paypal.me/Einlion</p><p>Discord Invite: https://discord.gg/Jwa8PKh</p></main><div class="link-group"><a class="btn" href="01462.html">Previous</a><a class="btn" href="../index.html">Table of Contents</a><a class="btn" href="01464.html">Next</a></div></div><div id="readpos">0%</div></body></html>
