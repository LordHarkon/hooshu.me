<p>In preparation for the upcoming 'Imperial Gala', Vahn was meeting with Solon and a disgruntled Zelretch as they discussed implementing the Virtual World and assigning Companions as part of the standard curriculum. Since he would effectively be taking over the Mage's Association after the gala, it was necessary to implement rapid changes to emphasize this fact to the faculty and student body.</p><p>With this in mind, Da Vinci had already prepared a localized Nexus specifically for use within the Clock Tower. As for the matter of Companions, there were several factories that could produce several thousand of the adorable creatures daily so, with the 'Purge' being a recent event, it wouldn't be that difficult to issue them throughout the entirety of the Mage's Association.</p><p>As Solon had mellowed out considerably after becoming Vahn's Subordinate, much to Zelretch's chagrin, there was virtually no resistance against the idea of implementing the updated system. It had already become a hot topic amongst members of the student body and, while they wouldn't openly admit it, many of the faculty members were also eager to delve into the Virtual World. The rumor it could emulate advanced Thaumaturgical processes with a negligible margin of error was too tempting to pass up as, using it, they could effectively test their theories without wasting any actual resources.</p><p>The only person proactively against the idea, for various reasons, was Zelretch as, with his ability to freely traverse between parallel worlds, he had already seen several versions of the same tech. In almost every instance, Virtual Reality was either the result or the direct contributor to societal collapse, as, with a virtual environment to meet all of their needs, people quickly lost motivation to live normal lives. He had even seen instances of virtual cults give rise to Cyber Daemons and Artificial Deities, entities that could influence the Virtual World and reality in equal measure.</p><p>Vahn assured him that their system was different than the ones he had experienced but, as many of those very systems started off with similar intentions, he was skeptical. After all, once the global population had been placated by the system, making it impossible for them to function without it, it could be used to manipulate them with considerable ease.</p><p>When this was pointed out, Vahn could only shake his head as, while Zelretch's words struck at the truth of the matter, the system designed by Da Vinci was far more comprehensive than what most people could rationalize. The Empire also took a 'hands-off' approach to governance while also proactively encouraging people to engage in the real world. There were always people who sought real thrills so, if they promoted a system that elevated a person's status based on real-world accomplishments, people would quickly compete for a better ranking.</p><p>With a system that focused more on a person's merits than concepts like hereditary wealth and given status, future generations would be demonstrably more capable than their modern-day counterparts. There was even a system designed to track a person's Parameters, Skills, and other metrics so that they could distinguish themselves in a society that seamlessly blended the virtual world with the real world. Since there were people who would literally spend thousands of hours speed-running the same game for nothing more than recognition within a small community, Vahn had little doubt that the system designed by Da Vinci would be a success.</p><p>Since it was all but impossible to change Vahn's mind after he had already drawn a conclusion, Zelretch ultimately gave up with a defeated sigh. He had started looking a lot older these days and, though his red-eyes still blazed with fervor and borderline madness, everyone that closely associated with him could see that he was beginning to lose his edge. Though he wasn't down and out just yet, it felt like each passing day made him less relevant as, with Vahn forcibly seizing control of the present, most tangential timelines were influenced by the echoes of his choices.</p><p>Fortunately, while it became increasingly tiring to try and reason with Vahn, the latter never failed to provide delicious tea and a plethora of otherworldly delicacies. Zelretch could still remember the first time he had been treated to 'Dragon Steak', the most delicious and mana-rich foodstuff he had ever had the privilege to sample. Thus, while he would sometimes have the urge to just go 'all-out' against the immovable Emperor, he managed to restrain it...</p><p>This time, while discussing the upcoming Imperial Gala and the implementation of the Virtual World, Vahn had prepared baked apples. These had been grown selectively by the Dryads that now called Avalon their home and, as a result, they were even more delicious than the already legendary apples that had been present prior to their arrival. A single slice, while not enough to fill a person's stomach, provided them with enough nourishment for three days as, due to how the human body processed ingested magical energy, a single apple could effectively provide upwards of 60,000kcal.</p><p>Since they were all 'monsters' who had effectively infinite Magical Power, Vahn, Zelretch, and Solon were able to freely engorge themselves on the lightly baked, cinnamon covered, apple slices. This, combined with their choice between a mellow and fragrant tea, turned an otherwise tense conversation into a relatively pleasant experience. Even Zelretch found it hard to stay mad while, at the side, Solon absentmindedly nibbled on the slices with absolutely no consideration for appearances.</p><p>Compared to the past, when they covered their body in various Artifacts, the current Solon could generally be found wearing nothing but a white robe, their usual medallion, and a total of three rings. This was a stark contrast to the dozens of Artifacts they previously wore but, after gaining a set of Magic Circuits, most had become redundant. They already knew how to activate complex Spells after thousands of years of research so, while the Artifacts could still be used to enhance their capabilities, they had been making a concerted effort to improve using the Quest Board.</p><p>Ultimately, the main reasons behind Zelretch's annoyance with the changes to Solon were the fact he also wanted access to the Quest Board but, much like Aoko and Arcueid, the Familia Crest had absolutely no effect on him. As a Tier 5 entity, Vahn was unable to give his Blessing to the elderly Magus and, as his pride wouldn't allow him to become subordinate to another, Zelretch had no choice but to listen to Solon drone on and on about their progress, all while he was forced to sit on the sidelines...</p><p>---</p><p>After confirming the plans to implement the Virtual World and distribute Companions, Vahn shifted the topic, asking, "Will the two of you attend the gala? I won't force you but, considering what it represents, your presence would be welcome. I have already confirmed Director Atlasia's participation so it would be problematic if you elected not to attend, Solon."</p><p>Though even the thought of attending a social gathering made them feel nauseous, Solon didn't hesitate to nod their head, lazily muttering, "I will attend..."</p><p>Seeing his long-time companion instantly acquiesce, Zelretch couldn't help but release a sigh as he reclined his head back, staring up at the sky as he answered, "I will also attend. Even if I'm not a direct affiliate of the Empire, I would like to consider us more than acquaintances. This will be an important event so, while I will likely not attend future gatherings, I can make an exception on this occasion."</p><p>Hearing Solon and Zelretch agree to attend, Vahn issued a relieved sigh within his mind as, with their participation, things became a lot easier. He knew that, despite their willingness to join the Empire, the vast majority of Magus families still disagreed with his methods. They merely joined with the intent of preserving their family and legacy so, by having a greater number of powerful and influential figures appear in support of the Empire, most dissidents would think twice about plotting against them.</p><p>Since their straightforward response had saved him a lot of time in trying to convince them, Vahn gave an approving nod before saying, "Soon enough, I will invite both of you to visit Avalon on holiday. I, too, would like to think we have made considerable progress toward becoming friends so, to officiate things, inviting you into my home should suffice. I'm aware it is something you have been interested in for quite some time, so, when the opportunity presents, I hope you accept my invitation."</p><p>Though Solon was admittedly interesting in touring Avalon, a place where thousands of Spirits now dwelled, it was Zelretch whom Vahn had directed his comment toward. The latter had been skulking around Avalon every now and then so, with the promise of a future invitation, his tired eyes regained some of their lost vigor as he offered a toothy grin and answered, "It would be a great honor to tour your home, even for a short period of time. I look forward to the opportunity and pray it comes even a single day sooner."</p><p>As he had already made preparations for Zelretch's arrival, Vahn could actually invite the man at any time. The only reason he hadn't was due to the Empire's relatively shaky internal affairs as, after the fiasco involving Scáthach, things had become more than a little awkward. She had left an impact on a number of people so, learning the infamous Purple Monster had lost her life, many within the Inner Sanctum couldn't quite believe it. They, much like Vahn, didn't really know how to treat the Lily version of her while Ciel, having spontaneously lost her mentor, now apprenticed directly under Vahn.</p><p>It would take some time for the reality that the original Scáthach was no longer with them but, in the meantime, Vahn had started using the time he once used to train with his Shishou in order to mentor quite a number of people. He now taught a class consisting of Fenrir, Gareth, Mordred, Sakura, Mash, Astrid, Zoë, Ciel, and, of course, Scáthach.</p><p>Though he still hadn't fully accepted everything that happened, Vahn had been taking small steps forward with each passing day. It was at moments like this that his expansive support group came in handy as, without their constant care and guidance, Vahn would have holed himself up for days on end, basically throwing a tantrum. Instead, he had dozens of people pushing him forward, the principal offenders being those like Fenrir, Artoria, and, for completely different reasons, each of his children...</p><p>Vahn always wanted to set a proper example for his children so, rather than let them see him at his lowest, he forced himself to bounce back after explaining the situation to them. Though they had never known Scáthach in the same way as everyone else, Vahn knew they would feel begin to feel doubts if they were left out of the loop. He liked to be open and honest with them so, while it wasn't easy, Vahn had talked with each of his children, explaining the situation so that they might understand why everyone was behaving differently than before...</p><p>The hardest part of being a parent was taking into consideration how your children interpreted your behavior when you were experiencing things they might not understand. You constantly had to remind yourself that, even though you were hurting, your responsibility as a parent superseded everything else. If you took the time to wallow in self-pity, ignoring the people who relied on you more than anyone else, the negativity would only spread without end. It was easier to be honest with them as, while they may not understand exactly why you are hurting, they would still be able to empathize with you.</p><p>The feeling of inclusion was a powerful factor when it came to raising your children as, if they felt involved, even in matters completely unrelated to them, they learned the importance of sharing their own troubles. Bottling things up was never healthy and, while it was important for everyone to have their secrets, keeping them at the expense of the people you loved was rarely the correct choice...</p><p>(A/N: Alternate Titles: 'If there is a leaderboard, someone would do their best to get to the top of it...','Zelretch is hella jaded','No matter how uncertain you feel, you should never compromise the feeling of certainty your child has toward you. You are their rock. While you may be shaken and tossed about by the tumultuous seas of life, you are the anchor that keeps them from being swept away in the same current...')</p><p>https://bit.ly/2XBzAYu &lt;-(p.atreon link)</p><p>paypal.me/Einlion</p><p>Discord Invite: https://discord.gg/Jwa8PKh</p></main><div class="link-group"><a class="btn" href="01407.html">Previous</a><a class="btn" href="../index.html">Table of Contents</a><a class="btn" href="01409.html">Next</a></div></div><div id="readpos">0%</div></body></html>
