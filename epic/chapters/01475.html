<p>Starting off his 'summoning party', Vahn cycled through the information listed on the Throne's terminal before selecting Sigurd and summoning him as a Saber Class. Though his legend had striking similarities with Siegfried, to the point they were both fabled to have killed Fafnir, they were, in truth, entirely different beings. The principle difference between them, excluding their actual origins, was the fact that Sigurd wielded the legendary [Gram], a demonic sword that had been reforged after being destroyed by Odin. As for Siegfried, his [Balmung] was derived from a fragment of Sigurd's [Gram], but, rather than an artifact that had been passed down since time immemorial, it had been forged by the Nibelungen tribe as a Holy, Dragon Slaying, sword...</p><p>Perhaps as a result of his status as Siegfried's precursor, Sigurd's Parameters and Skills were all a fair amount higher. In fact, other than the strength of their Noble Phantasms, with Siegfried's able to reach EX-Rank when overloaded, Sigurd completely outclassed Vahn's faithful friend. Though the former's [Armor of Fafnir] would undoubtedly allow him to contend against Sigurd, it seemed that the latter was more than a match for the legendary Dragon Knight.</p><p>Curious what form the 'King of Warriors' would take, Vahn confirmed his selection, returning to the outside world to witness the return of Northern Europe's 'Greatest Hero'. What he saw didn't disappoint, as, despite Sigurd's relatively short height, standing at only 178cm, he stood out as a rather heroic and intimidating personage. Though it was impossible to make out his appearance, as he seemed to be wearing some kind of 'futuristic' armor, Vahn found the structure of his wolf-like helmet and sleek black clothing to be quite cool...</p><p>Improving Vahn's evaluation even further, Sigurd's helmet released a hissing sound, followed by a small burst of steam as the helmet depressurized. Then, similar to Mordred's, the helm began to change shape, magical mechanisms activating to transform it into metallic collar that seamlessly integrated into his body-armor. This allowed Vahn to see Sigurd's appearance, reminiscent of an intellectual with handsome features and icy-blue eyes. What stood out the most, however, was his rather unique hairstyle, silvery-white on the sides and onyx-black down the center. It was spiked in a stylish manner that, when combined with the black-rimmed glasses adorning his face, gave him an appearance similar to a modern fashion model, rather than a Hero from Germanic folklore...</p><p>As Sigurd's appearance was simply too 'modern', Vahn couldn't help but raise his brow, asking, "I didn't summon the wrong person, did I? You are the Great Hero from the Völsunga Saga, Sigurd, correct?"</p><p>Without showing a single change in expression, almost as if he were a machine, Sigurd replied in a very terse manner, dully stating, "Indeed." before falling silent. He didn't seem to have any care or concern for why he had been summoned. Rather, he was simply awaiting orders, his sense of duty and purpose superseding everything else.</p><p>Vahn was impressed by Sigurd's bearing, but, as he wanted to quickly wrap up the summoning procedure, he simply nodded his head, saying, "Good. I have summoned you for the purpose of aiding a group known as the Heroes Faction. One of their members is Brynhildr, the very same Valkyrian woman from your own legend. I had taken pity on her plight, so, while it may not have been fair to you, I have called you nonetheless. I will not force you against your will, but I would appreciate it if you are able to restore a bit of happiness to that tragic woman's life..."</p><p>Though there wasn't a single change in Sigurd's expression, Vahn hadn't missed the fluctuations in the man's aura. The mention of Brynhildr had caused his previously placid aura to turn slightly chaotic, but, by the time he had finished explaining things, it became mellow and calm. From this, it could be deduced that, at the very least, Sigurd still had some affection for the forlorn beauty, even if his response was a simple, "Understood."</p><p>Quickly realizing Sigurd was the type of person that treated their words like precious gold, Vahn didn't waste too much time trying to converse with him. This was probably for the best, as, due to how peculiar Sigurd's outfit and equipment were, it was pretty hard not to inquire about them. It might not be his main focus, but Vahn was still a Blacksmith, so, seeing the 'unknown' materials that made up Sigurd's body-armor, he couldn't help feeling curious...</p><p>After having Sigurd wait at the side, Vahn activated the Throne of Heroes a second time, now with the intent to summon Sasaki Kojirou.</p><p>According to the account of both Rin and Artoria, there was no account that a swordsman named Sasaki Kojirou ever actually existed. This was one of the reasons Vahn hadn't contested Musashi's desire to summon the man, as, while he may not have existed in the current Time Axis, it was all but certain he manifested in others. After all, Musashi herself was the one who had dueled, and, ultimately killed, the famous samurai.</p><p>Since the Throne of Heroes could even summon Conceptual Entities, manifesting a swordsman who never existed in the current Time Axis was a simple feat. Even if he was a fictional person, his legend had been recorded upon the Throne. This essentially made him the 'concept' of Sasaki Kojirou, but, considering Heroic Spirits weren't actually the person themselves, it wasn't incorrect to say this was the case for everyone.</p><p>After confirming his selection, making sure to designated Kojirou's Class as 'Saber', Vahn found himself back in the real world, watching as a 176cm tall Japanese man with indigo hair began to manifest in front of him. He was attired in a traditional light purple hakama, a similar kimono, light purple tabi, black geta, and a dark-purple haori. Purple seemed to be his absolutely favorite color as, looking on his back, even his long katana was sheathed in a dark-purple scabbard, it's blade and handle combining to extend nearly the full length of his body.</p><p>Though this was often the case with every Heroic Spirit, Sasaki Kojirou was a rather handsome man, especially with his indigo hair tied in a high ponytail. Its length managed to reach the small of his back, and, though it didn't make much sense, his bangs were neatly arched in a way that allowed them to frame his face, extending nearly to his collarbone. His most striking feature was his indigo eyes, however, as they seemed to radiate a peculiar light, despite also seeming to be impossibly deep and unfathomable.</p><p>Preempting Vahn's words, Kojirou, with a serious expression on his face, asked, "You are my Lord? Why have you summoned me into this world...?"</p><p>As he still had two more people to summon, Vahn kept his introduction and explanation relatively brief, stating, "My name is Vahn Aldrnari Mason, the Sage Dragon Emperor, ruler of the Aldrnari Empire. I am not your Lord, though I am the one who summoned you. As for your purpose, I have called upon your services to aid a faction of Heroes. The decision to join them is ultimately your own to make. However, you should know that the person who suggested you be summoned is none other than your former enemy, Miyamoto Musashi, albeit a female version."</p><p>Kojirou looked like he was moments away from drawing his sword when he heard mention of Musashi, but, hearing the latter half of Vahn's statement, he had an incredulous expression as he asked, "He became a woman...?"</p><p>Amused by Kojirou's reaction, Vahn allowed himself to smile as he explained, "It is a complicated matter. All you really need to understand is that there are multiple, virtually infinite, worlds. There is even a female version of Sasaki Kojirou somewhere in the multiverse, so, while it may seem like a stretch, know that my words are the truth. Soon enough, you will witness the reality with your own eyes."</p><p>Though it was difficult to believe, Kojirou nodded his head solemnly in response to Vahn's words. At the same time, his hands balled into fists, as, even if it wasn't the Musashi he 'remembered', it was still his arch-nemesis. Now that fate had brought them together again, he would not rest until he was able to cross blades with his old enemy, vindicating him of his past self's greatest shame.</p><p>Vahn could sense the blade-like intensity radiating from Kojirou's body, but, as the main reason Musashi had suggested the former's summoning was so that they could fight, he wasn't going to interfere. Rather, a 'healthy rivalry' could allow them both to become much stronger, so, as long as it didn't devolve into a blood feud, he didn't mind a bit of conflict within the Heroes Faction.</p><p>After introducing Sigurd and having Kojirou wait along the periphery, Vahn entered the Throne, only now realizing he was summoning four Saber Class Heroic Spirits. This filled him with a strong temptation to change things up, but, as Suzuka Gozen only qualified for the Saber, Assassin, Lily, and Alter Ego Classes, it didn't seem wise to use her. Rather, by reading the Flow of Fate, he was able to see the rather aggressive fox-like Yokai attacking him with her sword, frustrated by the fact she had been summoned as a child...</p><p>As the Assasin and Alter Ego versions of Gozen also seemed rather troublesome, Vahn just went ahead and summoned her as a Saber. He knew this version of her would eventually become one of Tamamo's servants, but, as her swordsmanship and intelligence allowed her to compete with both Musashi and Da Vinci, Vahn was quite looking forward to it. Though he would never say this to the woman in question, her bashful expression was already imprinted in his mind, her charm as a kitsune not wasted upon him...</p><p>With his selection complete, Vahn watched as a young woman, standing approximately 164cm tall, manifested before him. She had pale, strawberry-beige, hair, and, as could be expected of a kitsune, two fox-like ears situated neatly atop her head. They were much smaller than Tamamo's, but, with her pale-gold, paradoxically serious yet mischievous eyes, Gozen had her own unique charm.</p><p>Unlike Sigurd, who had the appearance of a futuristic warrior, Gozen looked like someone who was cosplaying a character from the Heian period. She was attired in a red Shirabyōshi outfit that gave her a number of similarities with a Shrine Maiden. She even had on a black tate-eboshi hat, red hakama, and a red suikan, a robe that was often worn over lighter garments. What stood out the most, however, was the fact that she didn't seem to be wearing panties, but, considering the garment didn't exist during her time period, that wasn't exactly 'wrong'...</p><p>Meeting Vahn's gaze, the edges of Gozen's mouth curled into a smile as she said, "My, you are a rather handsome one, aren't you? In fact..."</p><p>Looking away from Vahn for a brief moment, Gozen stared at Sigurd and Kojirou standing off to the side, adding, "You are all quite handsome..."</p><p>Though he didn't know exactly how Gozen would become Tamamo's subordinate, Vahn was able to make a few assumptions. She radiated a rather haughty aura, much like one of the young noble heiresses that attended the Clock Tower. The look in her eyes gave off the impression that she did not consider others on the same level, but, considering she was the only child of the 'Demon King of the Fourth Heaven', dispatched to rule over a chaotic Japan, this wasn't entirely unexpected.</p><p>Drawing Gozen's attention back to him, Vahn gave her a similar introduction and explanation as Sigurd and Kojirou. His status as an Emperor seemed to intrigue her a fair amount, but, when she learned she would be sent away to fight alongside another faction, she seemed to lose interest, asking, "Do I really have to do something so troublesome? I'll fight if I have to, but I don't really want to get involved with another person's mess. What do I get out of helping a bunch of people I never met? I'd rather stay in the Empire and enjoy this new life of mine. Come on, Ten'nō-sama, I promise I'll make it worth your while~."</p><p>Sounding like a teenager going through her rebellious phase, Gozen seemed to have absolutely no interest in joining the Heroes Faction. She reminded Vahn of the duo of students who had tried to proposition him shortly after his entry into the Nasuverse. In fact, by using his ability to read the Flow of Fate, Vahn knew it would take virtually no effort to solicit the haughty kitsune. She seemed to be a bit of an opportunist, so, after learning his status, securing a place at his side become one of her chief priorities.</p><p>Despite his reduced opinion of the woman standing before him, Vahn had already said he wasn't going to force any of them. He knew Musashi had selfishly requested the summoning of Gozen in order to fight against her, not specifically to secure the latter as an ally. Rather, due to her nature as a Yokai, Vahn would have extended the same offer to her as the one he had given Shuten and the rest.</p><p>Remembering he couldn't judge her by the values of a human, Vahn's impression of Gozen no longer decreased. Then, offering a polite smile, he explained his intentions to establish a Yokai Distinct within Avalon, something she seemed more than a little interested in. After all, she was basically a Yokai Princess, born from the union between a 'Demon God' and a Fox Spirit. Though this status meant very little in the present, most Yokai would recognize her status as a result of the hierarchal nature of their society.</p><p>While not directly comparable to True Dragons, Yokai recognized certain subsets of their species as being innately superior to others. They elevated those such as Tengu, Kitsune, Dragons, and Oni to a much higher level than the myriad of other species present within their community. This was due to the fact that Lesser Yokai were able to benefit from the 'miasma' that naturally radiated from more powerful Yokai, allowing them to sustain themselves in exchange for service. It was for this reason that so many sparrow-type Yokai lingered around Benienma, so, with Gozen being a Kitsune who also possessed A-Rank [Divinity], she would undoubtedly rise to a similar status as Shuten.</p><p>It wasn't difficult to imagine Gozen trying to usurp Shuten's place as the ruler of the Yokai District, but, while the lascivious Oni would undoubtedly reign supreme in the moonlit realm, the position of 'strongest' would ultimately fall to Tamamo. Once Gozen encountered the legendary Bunrei of Amaterasu, she would experience suppression similar to what other Dragons experienced around him. Though Gozen might have enough power to defeat both Tamamo and Shuten, doing so was virtually impossible, as, should she even try, her own status would be compromised irreversibly...</p><p>Unaware of the existence of Tamamo, Gozen was more than happy to become a member of the Yokai community, a smile on her face as she answered, "That sounds a lot more interesting than running around with a bunch of so-called Heroes. I'll make sure to build a large residence that is suitable for Ten'nō-sama's status. I trust you'll be visiting often, yes~?"</p><p>With what could only be described as a 'too-eager' look on her face, Gozen attempted to move a little closer to Vahn, her vulpine ears twitching slightly. In response, he couldn't help but smile in amusement, saying, "Certainly. I'm looking forward to Lady Gozen's hospitality..."</p><p>Gozen seemed satisfied by Vahn's response, but, if she knew he was intending to bring over both Artoria and Tamamo, the smile on her face would have quickly faded away. The moment she met the two 'possessive' women, both with far greater heritage and bloodline, Gozen would have little choice but to acquiesce. Even without peeking into the future, Vahn could imagine the bitter look on her face as she was relegated to the status of a handmaiden, dutifully serving Tamamo in the hopes of trying to win his affections...</p><p>After having Gozen join the others at the side, Vahn proceeded with the final summon. When he approached the terminal, he, once again, considered whether or not he should pull a 'prank' on the one being summoned. Though it seemed rather cruel, the person being summoned generally wouldn't care about such things, as, from their perspective, it was only natural they existed in such a state. Alexander was a bit of an outlier in the Lily department, but that was largely related to the scope of his legend as the 'King of Conquerors'...</p><p>Though it took nearly two hours, Vahn was finally able to isolate who he believed to be the Altria from the 'Servant Universe'. This was achieved by filtering for versions of 'Altria Pendragon' that had already been summoned, matching them with the Skills listed within his Unit Management. It had taken a while due to the sheer number of worlds that existed, but, due to his efforts, Vahn was able to find a surprising number of women named Altria Pendragon, all from the same Time Axis.</p><p>Of the thousands of names listed, only a few had the [Cosmo Reactor] previously mentioned by Altria. After a few more tweaks, Vahn was able to narrow the possibilities down to three, virtually identical, versions of the same woman. The only difference between them was the period of time in which they seemed to appear, separated by a few thousand years. This made it seem as though they were the reincarnation of the same person, though, without summoning each of them, it was impossible to be certain.</p><p>What Vahn found interesting was the fact that, with each iteration, Altria seemed to get much stronger. The final version of her even possessed a version of Rhongomyniad, qualifying as almost every Servant Class, including Avenger, Beast, Foreigner, and Savior. This made her seem rather scary, causing Vahn to peer into the Flow of Fate to help guide his decision. What he saw caused him to pale slightly, as, out of curiosity, he ended up peeking at the Savior version of Altria...</p><p>While most other versions seemed to be a relatively mature version of Artoria, Vahn's mind began to stagnate when he saw the childish, almost chibi, version of the same woman. She appeared no older than ten years old, but, in stark contrast to her appearance, she wore virtually no clothing. Instead, her limbs seemed to be formed of the fabric of Space, appearing much like the night sky, filled with stars. As for the rest of her body, it still seemed to be formed of flesh, her nonexistent breasts covered by nothing more than a thin band of fabric. What stood out the most, however, so long as you ignored the fairy-like wings on her back, was that her lower body was covered by nothing more than a belt. Fortunately, she didn't seem to possess a sexual organ, indicating she was some kind of synthetic life form, functionally similar to Alaya...</p><p>Deciding against summoning a child-like version of his wife, especially after just awakening her draconic nature, Vahn turned his attention to another current. This time, he focused peeked in on the Foreigner version, as, due to the nature of Foreigner Class Servants, they were often powerful and mysterious. What he found was a mature version of Artoria, appearing in her mid-twenties...</p><p>For reasons he could only speculate, the Foreigner version of Artoria seemed to be attired in a white bikini, fastened together by blue strings. She had a strange top that only covered her arms and shoulders, leaving her rather developed body completely exposed for all to see. What stood out the most, however, was the fact she was wearing a blue cap, her hair tied into a ponytail that was reminiscent of Mordred. As for why this was strange, it was due to the fact that Vahn could see an ahoge, seemingly poking through the hat as it glistened like a piece of gold fabric...</p><p>Though he could summon the weaker, more petite, version of Altria, Vahn felt compelled by the woman's ahoge to summon the Foreigner. Not only was she much stronger, possessing several EX-Rank Skills, but, based on what he had been able to ascertain, she also possessed some kind of mechanical suit. This was too interesting to ignore, and, knowing she would almost certainly come to reside in Avalon, summoning a stronger, more mature, version seemed prudent.</p><p>While confirming his selection, Vahn was glad he had taken the time to help Artoria obtain her true form. The version of Altria he was summoning was around the same height as her, but, going by their figures, there was a clear disparity between them. Thus, if he had summoned Altria prior to Artoria's awakening, she likely wouldn't have taken it too kindly. Now, even though another beauty that shared similar features had been called, she was currently more concerned with the reactions everyone had to her new form...</p><p>(A/N: Alternate Titles: 'Sigurd be like, "..."','RIP Gozen','TFW the 'strongest' version of your waifu has the appearance of a grade-schooler with exhibitionist tendencies...')</p><p>https://bit.ly/2XBzAYu &lt;-(p.atreon link)</p><p>paypal.me/Einlion</p><p>Discord Invite: https://discord.gg/Jwa8PKh</p></main><div class="link-group"><a class="btn" href="01474.html">Previous</a><a class="btn" href="../index.html">Table of Contents</a><a class="btn" href="01476.html">Next</a></div></div><div id="readpos">0%</div></body></html>
