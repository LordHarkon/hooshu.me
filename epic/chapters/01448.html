<p>By the time Vahn had finished detailing the events surrounding Scáthach, leaving out most of the sensitive details, Aife had become slightly catatonic. She had always felt a powerful rivalry towards her younger sister, who, from the time they were young girls, had excelled in everything. There were many factors that increased the tensions between them, especially when it came to Cú, but, despite having fought an actual war against each other, she never harbored hatred toward her sister, only a desire to claim victory.</p><p>As a result of her incredulity, Aife ended up shaking her head, stating, "You're lying...you must be.", even though she could tell that Vahn was speaking the truth. She just couldn't accept that her sister had died, even if part of her was relieved that Scáthach finally found the peace she had sought.</p><p>Vahn had been gauging Aife's reaction through the entire conversation, so, seeing how shaken the red-headed woman was, he felt slightly relieved. Scáthach had rarely talked about her older sister, as the two had spent much of their life separated from each other, so it was a relief to see that Aife still cared. Unfortunately, it was a little too early to allow her and the Lily version of Scáthach to meet, as there was no way of knowing what kind of sequelae would come about as a result.</p><p>Rather than refute Aife's words, Vahn allowed his true feelings on the matter to come to the surface, his eyes showing the melancholy that still existed within his heart. This was enough to cause a light layer of moisture to cover Aife's eyes, but, other than adopting what could only be described as a pouting gesture, she didn't cry. She simply chose not to believe his words, even if, in her heart, she knew her little sister was gone.</p><p>Before things could devolve any further, Vahn explained the situation surrounding Archimedes and the agreement he had reached with Shirou and Musashi. This didn't seem to matter all that much to Aife, however, at least until he added, "Your sister's legacy still exists in this world. One day, when the conflict between our two sides has settled, you will come to learn the full story surrounding her final moments. Even if you choose not to continue the fight, you must show me that you're able to live in this world without causing unnecessary harm...I will not tell you how to live, but, if it infringes upon the rights all people deserve, expect repercussions..."</p><p>Though she was still honor-bound to fight for Archimedes, the fact he had already died allowed Aife to make her own decisions. She was intending to join the Empire, both as a matter of course and to ascertain the truth of her sister's death, but, after hearing Vahn's words, she realized it wouldn't be a simple matter. His words made it clear that, even if she ended up surrendering, that didn't mean she would be allowed within Avalon. She was still his enemy until she had proven herself worthy of trust, a stark contrast to how things had been done in her own era. Considering how commonplace things like treachery and betrayal had been, however, she could somewhat understand his concerns...</p><p>In truth, Vahn was tempted to accept Aife into their ranks, as, with the six [Seal of Binding] he had obtained long ago, he could effectively designate himself as the Master of any Heroic Spirit. Though this required the target's acquiescence, often requiring the death of their former Master, he didn't imagine Aife would refuse his offer after her previous defeat. The only thing that prevented him from using them was the fact that his Unit Management made the item virtually useless for anything other than 'forcing' a target to obey.</p><p>While it would certainly make things easier for him, Vahn felt it was important to have something like the 'Heroes Faction'. He was hoping to use them as the foundation to develop the counterpart to the Mage's Guild he intended to establish in the near future. It was important for people to feel as if they had the means to 'escape' the confines of the Empire, and, though all people would be bound by the Common Law, they could experience 'freedom' by rising through the ranks of the Mages and Heroes Guilds.</p><p>Though it was possible to create the Heroes Guild using his own forces, people would be more open to the idea of joining the force that, for a time, directly opposed the Empire. This was why Vahn had encouraged Shirou to build his own faction, traveling around the world and uniting people towards a common goal. Even if this goal was to 'resist' the Empire's control, it wouldn't really matter, so long as the Common Law was still upheld.</p><p>With this in mind, Vahn refused Aife's request to join the Empire before it even left her lips. She had a flashy Noble Phantasm that would leave a deep impact on people. Thus, having her on the side of Shirou and Musashi would be optimal, especially given their small numbers. There had already been instances of mutated animals reported throughout the world, so, pretty soon, 'monsters' would likely begin emerging. The people would need something to rally behind and there were few things more inspiring than seeing an entire army of crystalline warriors holding the line.</p><p>Aife was unaware of Vahn's true intentions, but, with the intent of setting out to prove herself worthy of his trust, she carried a copy of the Common Law with her upon leaving the Ivory Castle. While she didn't accept the fact that Shirou and Musashi had become their de facto leaders, she still intended to meet with them, helping to convince the others. The Empire's forces were too strong for them to directly contend against, so, rather than fight an all-out war, shifting their focus to Vahn alone would save them a lot of time and effort. It was time they stop hiding in the shadows, becoming the Heroes they purported themselves to be...</p><p>---</p><p>Having heard the details from Shirou, Musashi, and Caenis, Atalanta quickly returned to Chang'e's Moon Rabbit Palace. She harbored little hope that Jason would actually acquiesce, but, if she could convince him that his death was assured if he didn't, he should at least 'pretend' to obey. Then, they could only hope that the Sage Dragon Emperor didn't have the means to see through Jason's usual facade, dooming them all as a result of his inability to lower himself to others.</p><p>With her speed, Atalanta was able to quickly reach her destination, bounding up the steep terrain of Chang'e's territory as if it were flat ground. When she reached the top, she landed silently near the same ledge she had jumped from previously, her cat-like ears twitching as her nostrils flared almost imperceptibly. This allowed her to ascertain whether or not Jason had summoned anyone else while she was gone, something she would rather avoid due to her general dislike towards the majority of the Argonauts.</p><p>Fortunately, with the exception of a considerable number of rabbits, there didn't seem to be any new presences within the palatial structure. Thus, with silent movements, Atalanta followed the wine-like aroma that always permeated Jason's body, quickly tracing the pungent fragrance back to its source.</p><p>Since Atalanta produced virtually no sound while moving, Jason nearly spilled his drink after seeing her enter the periphery of his vision. As a result, he adopted his characteristic scowl, shouting, "I told you not to sneak up on me like that! Can't you wear a bell or something!?"</p><p>Hearing Jason's remark, Atalanta's face formed a deep frown as, in the distant past, he had actually tried to 'gift' her a collar with a bell attached. Shortly after that, she ended up leaving the Argo, but, due to the nature of his Noble Phantasm, she now found herself accompanying the hateful man, this time with her very existence on the line.</p><p>Feeling a palpable bitterness on her tongue, Atalanta glared at Jason, venomously stating, "I came back with information pertaining to the continuation of your life. Now, I don't feel like explaining it to you."</p><p>With those parting words, Atalanta turned tail, alighting from the room with swift movements that were impossible for someone like Jason to follow. This left him glowering with an expression that alternated between red and white as he tried to forcibly calm himself. He knew Atalanta would just ignore him if he ended up lashing out at her, so, while he wanted nothing more than to drag her back by the tail, his reason, combined with the fact she was much stronger than him, kept him at bay.</p><p>Understanding she wasn't likely to disclose the information to him, Jason turned to Medea, a tired look on his face as he said, "Go and find out what Atalanta has learned. Return to me as soon as she discloses the information to you. Don't dally...go..."</p><p>With a demure bow, followed by a smile that never seemed to reach her eyes, Medea answered, "Of course, Master." Afterward, tiny, faerie-like wings appeared behind her back, allowing her to quickly follow after Atalanta, a resolute look replacing her previous smile. Since it was a matter pertaining to her 'beloved' Master's life, Medea couldn't forgive Atalanta for being so selfish as to keep the details to herself. She intended to give the cat-like woman a piece of her mind, albeit after politely inquiring about the details of her previous excursion...</p><p>Knowing Medea would carry out his orders without fail, Jason released a tired sigh before plopping onto his throne and muttering, "I miss the open seas..." before closing his eyes and recalling his past glory. He missed being able to freely travel, going on various adventures with his comrades as they fought against the forces of nature to claim fame and fortune. Though some had treated his group as a band of pirates, the fact he was a King, supported by many Demigods and Heroes, gave him the moral high ground in most situations.</p><p>Jason missed those simpler times, a time when City Lords and Kings would flock to the Ports every time his ship neared their cities. They would come bearing gifts of gold, wine, and other treasure, all in the hopes of requesting his assistance or preventing trouble. These offerings always gave Jason an overwhelming feeling of supremacy, as, during those days, he had been a disenfranchised prince, his throne claimed by another. Despite that, other Kings and Lords lowered their heads to him, dreading the consequences of triggering his ire...</p><p>Due to his reflection, Jason didn't notice when a woman gracefully sat at his side, a jade vase in hand as she dutifully filled his cup with fragrant plum wine. This broke him free from his reminiscent state, forcing a sigh from his lips as he unhesitantly accepted the proffered cup and said, "I usually do my best not to appear weak in front of others. Thank you, Chang'e, for never looking at me with eyes filled with scorn...truly, you are a good woman...haaaaa-"</p><p>Hearing Jason's compliment, Chang'e released a peal of sonorous laughter, sounding much like a gentle, soothing, bell. This brought a smile to Jason's face, allowing him to relax a bit after stressing out over the last few hours. He hated being cooped up in one place for a long period of time, but, if he had someone like Chang'e at his side, it wouldn't be all that bad. She was caring and attentive in a way that Greecian women couldn't quite match, something he was coming to appreciate more and more with each passing day.</p><p>If not for their difference in status, Jason wouldn't hesitate to make Chang'e his woman. Regrettably, the current dynamic between them meant that 'he' would become hers, something his pride didn't allow. Though it might not matter to some, as the end result was pretty much the same, it was a very important distinction, at least within Jason's mind. The other party being a Goddess only made him want her even more, as, if she agreed to become his, it would elevate his status even higher...</p><p>(A/N: Alternate Titles: 'Loki would be proud','Jason would do surprisingly well in the Record of One Piece...Cavendish, is that you!?','There is a meeting point between Pride, Hubris, Vanity, and Conceit. Jason exists at that intersection. He is basically a CN protagonist...')</p><p>https://bit.ly/2XBzAYu &lt;-(p.atreon link)</p><p>paypal.me/Einlion</p><p>Discord Invite: https://discord.gg/Jwa8PKh</p></main><div class="link-group"><a class="btn" href="01447.html">Previous</a><a class="btn" href="../index.html">Table of Contents</a><a class="btn" href="01449.html">Next</a></div></div><div id="readpos">0%</div></body></html>
