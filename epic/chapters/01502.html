<p>With the loss of his Sex Divinity, Vahn felt as if a great weight had been lifted off his shoulders. He hadn't lost any of his 'prowess', but, compared to before, he now had to put more effort and focus into his partner's needs. Fortunately, he knew most of their bodies even better than they did, so, while he lost the ability to instinctively sense when they were in the mood, satisfying them wasn't a difficult matter. Rather, things had become even more intimate than before, as, rather than letting his Divinity help guide his actions, he had to default to closely observing them.</p><p>Prior to obtaining his Divinity, Vahn had always closely monitored the state of his partner, using his wealth of experience to determine the best course of action. He couldn't always know exactly how they wanted to be treated, but, in a way, making mistakes and learning made the experience far more interesting. Things became more experimental, fresh, and, as a result, his partners had also become a lot more 'honest'. They now directly conveyed what they wanted, sometimes far more vocally than he would have expected...</p><p>A stark contrast to her usual 'motherly' appearance, the current Iris was wearing an extremely skimpy outfit form from a malleable material that easily clung to the skin. With a set of golden horns on her head and a whip-like tail that came to an end in a heart shape, she matched what many believed a Succubus should look like. She even had the physique to match, complete with large breasts, a pliable butt, thick thighs, and a thin layer of subcutaneous fat that made her entire body soft and slightly squishy.</p><p>Though she was normally a very reserved woman, with a slight propensity for teasing others, the current Iris was skillfully dancing atop Vahn's waist, a lascivious look in her ruby-red eyes as she sonorously intoned, "Ah...that's good~! Hit that spot again...! Nnn...I can feel you stretching out my insides...ufufufu, you're going to ruin my body at this rate~."</p><p>Despite her words, Iris was happily bouncing her hips with enough force to cause loud smacking sounds to echo throughout the room. This was one of the few times she had ever gotten Vahn to herself, so, compared to her usual self, she was a little 'too eager'. As for where she got the outfit, it was, of course, one of Da Vinci's inventions. She had modified a few of the [REquip] systems to function similarly to faux Divine Raiments, allowing a host of unique outfits to be produced based almost entirely on a person's thoughts and feelings.</p><p>Manifesting even a 'false' Divine Raiment required a significant amount of Mana, but, with a body produced by Vahn and the ability to harness functionally infinite energy from the planet itself, Iris had little trouble maintaining a host of 'interesting' outfits. In the past, she had even produced a version that allowed her to emulate some of Illya's bestial traits, creating a dangerous 'gap' that left a very deep impression in Vahn's memory. He could still remember the scene of her pinning down Illya as she waggled her butt towards him, an eager and inviting look in her eyes that left no room for discussion...</p><p>With his fingers sinking into her fleshy butt, Vahn bucked Iris with enough force to send a visible ripple through her body. This also propelled her forward, causing her voluminous breasts to press into him as she intoned an amused, "Oh my~." before extending her tongue to greet his. Then, as their tongues continued to intertwine, Vahn continued for rhythmically 'pound' from below, using the durable springs of the mattress to maintain a steady pace while using his hands to prevent her hips from bouncing too far.</p><p>In the end, Iris' toes began to curl as she tightly hugged his neck and whispered heatedly in his ear, "You can feel it, right~? My womb has descended, begging for your seed. Fill me up until I'm bursting, ufufufu~."</p><p>Though she couldn't get pregnant unless they both wanted a child, Iris had become somewhat addicted to 'creampies'. Rather, all of the women who had the ability to absorb and convert mana were rather fond of feeling their insides stretch due to his voluminous release. It not only brought them to a peak of pleasure most couldn't even fathom, but it also provided a marginal increase to their power while helping to restore their stamina.</p><p>As he had developed the habit of almost always cumming inside, Vahn didn't hesitate at all when he heard Iris's words, grunting as he said, "Take it...!"</p><p>Immediately following his words, Iris arched her back into a seated position, eyes squinted shut as she shouted, "Aaaaahn, I can feel it! It's erupting inside me~!" at the top of her lungs. Her change in position also caused her to be seated flush against his lap, 'sealing' his semen inside of her and causing her lower abdomen to bloat slightly. When the pressure finally reached beyond a certain threshold, a 'pa' sound could be heard, followed by a considerable amount of heat and moisture covering Vahn's inner thighs...</p><p>With a distant look in her eyes, Iris continued to sit on his lap for more than a minute, her mouth slightly agape as a small amount of drool flowed from the side. She had a similar appearance to someone who had a little too much to drink, her face suffused with a ruddy hue and an apparent lack of awareness as a powerful tremor ran through her body. Then, just as the echoes began to fade away, she looked down at Vahn was heavily glazed eyes, smiling seductively as she said, "It's a shame I can't keep you to myself..."</p><p>Though he knew she was just playing around, Vahn lightly smacked Iris' butt, causing a girlish moan to emit from her throat. Then, before she could convince him to continue, Vahn couldn't help but grin as he remarked, "Rather than becoming more honest, I'd say you're becoming more greedy. That Succubus outfit suits you a little too well...it's a shame, really, but we'll have to wrap things up here. It's already been close to eleven hours. We're supposed to be leaving today, so we'll have to continue where we left off at a later date."</p><p>After finishing his statement, Vahn gave Iris' butt another firm smack, causing another sonorous moan to escape her throat before musing, "You're a big, mean, bully...". Immediately afterward, however, she leaned down, tightly hugging his neck and giving him a long and passionate kiss. Then, before separating, she licked the tip of his nose, adding, "I still love you though~."</p><p>Finding her words satisfying, Vahn couldn't help but release a somewhat boisterous laugh before 'surprising' Iris as he raised his body so that they were seated hugging each other. Then, despite his earlier words, he decided to take her for another round, this time taking it nice and slow as the two kissed each other passionately for an additional half-hour...</p><p>---</p><p>While four of his bodies were making the most of the remaining time in the Marble Phantasm, the 'prime' Vahn was walking backward, holding Gaia's hands as she took faltering steps forward. She could already walk unaided, but, if she tried to move too quickly, her feet would get wrapped up in themselves. This became even more prominent when he separated from her, causing her to fall over almost immediately, but that wasn't entirely unexpected.</p><p>Gaia had spent several millennia as little more than an incorporeal Spirit, and, even now, she had a fair amount of inhibitions toward maintaining a physical form. She saw herself as vulnerable and exceptionally weak, so, despite having an indestructible body with limitless physical potential, her countenance and physique matched her self-perception. It was so bad that, if someone else tried to help her walk, she wouldn't even be able to stand, much less move forward...</p><p>The most paradoxical thing about Gaia's state was that, if she really wanted to, ignoring things like gravity was well within her power. She should be able to fly around freely, phase through objects, and even manifest her body wherever she wanted. These were things she was well aware of, but, due to her mental blocks, simply maintaining a physical body was already pushing her limits.</p><p>Optimistically speaking, it would take several months for Gaia to complete the first phase of her physical rehabilitation. As for her mental rehab, that would undoubtedly take several years, if not considerably longer. Fortunately, time was something they had plenty of, so, while it would be a mild inconvenience, Vahn was willing to stay by her side until she was ready to walk on her own. It was, truthfully, the least he could do for someone who would remain at his side for millions, if not billions, of years...</p><p>After a few minutes of sustained walking, Gaia's face had formed into a strained pout, her fair complexion turning slightly pale as she struggled to keep pace with his greater gait. She was not able to experience fatigue in the same way as normal people, but, just as he was able to overtax his mind and spirit, so too was Gaia. Thus, despite having the physical strength to continue, Gaia ended up tripping forward, falling into Vahn's waiting arms with tears building up in the corners of her eyes as she muttered, "I'm sorry..."</p><p>Shaking his head, Vahn performed the usual ritual of combing his fingers through Gaia's hair as he whispered, "Shhhh...You're doing fine. That was thirteen more steps than your previous record. We have plenty of time for your rehabilitation so keep your head up high and continue trying your best. You are a lot cuter when you smile..."</p><p>Though it wasn't immediate, Gaia forced a smile on her face, but, if you looked into her gem-like eyes, it was possible to see the sadness contained within. She was actually pushing herself quite a bit, but, no matter how much hard she tried, her body just ignored her. The only time it seemed to completely obey her was when she was doing 'naughty' things with her Master. His presence had a calming effect on her body, so, when they were closer together, she felt safe, secure, and, to a greater extent, 'whole'.</p><p>After resting in her Master's arms for a few minutes, Gaia felt like strength had slowly returned to her body. She could feel his mysterious energy spread through her vessel like a nourishing wave, qualitatively increasing the purity of her own. This was something that excited her quite a bit, and, even without 'orders' to collect it, she would have happily done so. If she wasn't afraid it would be an inconvenience to him, she would have liked to emulate her 'sister', latching onto his body and just suckling his nourishing energy until the last stars burned out in the night sky...</p><p>Feeling Gaia spontaneously bite his tunic, gently sucking the piece of fabric with her eyes closed, Vahn had to forcibly restrain himself. She had developed a suckling habit over the last thirty days, and, at times, got a little carried away due to her curiosity. He found this incredibly adorable and highly endearing, but, as it could quickly become a problem in her 'adult' form, he lightly tapped her back, breaking her out of the momentary reverie she had fallen into.</p><p>Realizing what she had been doing, evidenced by a small stain on her Master's tunic, Gaia's face became slightly red as she fumbled for words. Before she was able to, however, he lightly tickled the underside of her chin, smiling as he said, "If you can make it to a thousand steps, I'll allow you to ride on my shoulder, at least for a short while."</p><p>Hearing her Master's words, Gaia's body spontaneously shrunk until she was roughly 40cm tall. At the same time, her features became closer to those of a Companion, albeit one with several fluffy, three pronounced ahoge, and large, ruby-red, eyes. She had 'learned' this from observing Alaya, and, while she was still unable to walk around on her own, she was able to easily cling to his body like a powerful magnet whenever she transformed...</p><p>Seeing Gaia shrink down, Vahn wasn't actually all that surprised. She had very little control over her body, so, when she got excited, her form changed to reflect her desires. This had caused her a considerable amount of embarrassment, as, even when she tried to control herself, her clothes would become increasingly transparent, eventually 'fading' from existence. She would also grow the features of her sisters whenever they were being stimulated, a trait that was as adorable as it was 'tantalizing'.</p><p>Rather than force her to change back, Vahn unequipped his tunic, hugging Gaia to his body as he said, "You can have a little. Afterward, you'll 'have' to get one-thousand steps, though. If not, we'll be soaking in the bath while everyone else is having fun. Rewards are supposed to follow success, so you'll have to work extra hard during your next attempt. Okay?"</p><p>As it was hard to calm down when her Master's exposed shoulder was right in front of her face, Gaia obediently listened to his words before readily nodding her head. Then, without a word, she opened her mouth to reveal rows of pearl-white teeth and a ruby-red tongue. They were normal at first, but, as she moved her mouth close to his neck, they immediately transitioned into sharper canines, sinking into his flesh without any resistance before forming a seal and sucking his blood rather greedily...</p><p>---</p><p>Immediately after her 'sister' began sucking their Master's blood, Alaya's expression formed into a small frown. She then began eyeing him like a predator eying its prey, earning a light chuckle from Vahn and a confused tilt of the head from Tiamat. At the same time, Arcueid and Fenrir gave him curious glances, leading Vahn to explain, "I'm giving Gaia a small incentive, " before turning his attention back to Alaya and adding, "Don't be jealous. You have received a number of benefits due to Gaia's influence. There will be plenty of time for you to drain my energy in the future."</p><p>Though she wanted to refute on principle, Alaya knew there was undeniable truth within her Master's words. The last thirty days had greatly exceeded preliminary expectations, so much so that it made her second-guess her past behavior. Now, she was even seated around a circular table, listening attentively as her Master conversed with others. Every now and then, she would even chime in of her own volition, something she never would have even considered in the past...</p><p>Understanding what Alaya must be thinking, Vahn gave a small nod, further stating, "We'll be leaving pretty soon to allow others to rotate in. There will be plenty of time for you to reap even greater rewards. For now, let us enjoy these last few moments. Is it such a bad thing, enjoying tea with your companions...?"</p><p>Alaya couldn't help but frown in response to her Master's words, but, rather than try to argue, she turned her attention to the contents of her cup. She, like everyone else at the table, was provided with a very special type of tea, sweetened with cubes crystallized from her Master's blood. It was significantly less satisfying than consuming his blood directly, but, prior to her sister being given the opportunity, Alaya had actually thought she was quite fortunate...</p><p>After considering her response for several moments in real-time, Alaya looked between Fenrir, Arcueid, and Tiamat before staring back at her Master and answering, "Master is correct...forgive me. I did not mean to cause a commotion..."</p><p>As the past Alaya would never compromise, much less apologize, Vahn smiled widely in response to her uncharacteristic words. She had made considerable progress over the last thirty days, and, though there was often a lack of sincerity behind her words, it was much better than before. There was even a chance, that, by the time Gaia's rehabilitation was over, Alaya would have, at the very least, started to break out of her shell. Thus, with a satisfied smile on his face, he playfully winked at her, saying, "Good girl..." in a teasing, yet affectionate, tone.</p><p>(A/N: Alternate Titles: 'Iris is a carnivorous woman o_o...','Must be hard to rehab when you 'don't even want to exist'...','Meanwhile, Tiamat is sitting at the side, eating the entire cup...')</p><p>https://bit.ly/2XBzAYu &lt;-(p.atreon link)</p><p>paypal.me/Einlion</p><p>Discord Invite: https://discord.gg/Jwa8PKh</p></main><div class="link-group"><a class="btn" href="01501.html">Previous</a><a class="btn" href="../index.html">Table of Contents</a><a class="btn" href="01503.html">Next</a></div></div><div id="readpos">0%</div></body></html>
