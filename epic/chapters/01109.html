<p>After passing a few hours just lounging on a sofa with his arm around Nobunaga's shoulder, mainly listening to her talk about what she had been up to the previous evening, Vahn knew he would need to head out pretty soon. He enjoyed the time they spent together but, now that Nobunaga had a bit too much to drink he knew it wouldn't be long before she either passed out, assuming she didn't have 'other' intentions. With that in mind, Vahn lifted Nobunaga's chin, looking into her deep red eyes with a hint of a smile on his face. In response to this, Nobunaga squinted slightly before closing the distance until she was only a few centimeters away from overlapping her lips with his. At this point, however, Nobunaga released a hot and rather foul-smelling breath right into his face before falling back on the sofa and cackling.</p><p>Snorting through his nose to clear the lingering smell, Vahn then lightly smacked Nobunaga's rump, causing her to roll so that her backside wasn't exposed before she began poking his face with her socked foot. She was obviously very drunk at the moment, causing Vahn to feel like he was taking care of a mischevious child as he guided Nobunaga's foot away from his face before 'snatching' her other foot and holding them in his lap. This caused her to wriggle around for a while before finally complaining, "You're sho stronk Vahn...muuu...what ish Nobu-chan to doooo~?"</p><p>Hearing Nobu refer to herself as 'chan', even though she looked like she was in her late twenties, Vahn felt a strong desire to tease her. As a result, Vahn began to gently rub up and down her legs, bringing Nobunaga to silence as she looked toward him with slightly hazy red eyes. Since it had just been the two of them, the only pieces of clothing Nobunaga was wearing was a black tank top, rather sexy, blood-red, panties, and a pair of black stockings that ran up to her thighs. Though she still preferred to wear men's clothes, Vahn knew Nobunaga went out of her way to dress up a bit for his benefit. Even if she never fully vocalized her intentions, it was clear that Nobunaga treated their relationship as something more than intimate companionship...</p><p>With her breathing becoming somewhat labored, Nobunaga silently rolled onto her side without trying to free her legs from Vahn's captivity. He took this as permission to slide his hand up the back of her thigh before gently rubbing her rather plump butt. At the same time, Vahn ran his right hand between her two legs, stroking Nobunaga's inner thigh as a gentle stimulation flowed from his palm, spreading into her body along with the relaxing energy of his Petting Laws. In this manner, Vahn let his hands wander around freely for the better part of ten minutes before Nobunaga released a hot sigh and commented, "You really like butts...fumuuu...." Though Vahn's right hand had been rather mischevious, his left hand had almost never left her backside since the moment she turned over.</p><p>In response to this, Vahn lightly tapped Nobunaga's rear end without putting any strength into the action, answering, "Though I feel everyone has their own unique appeal, I won't deny there is more than a little truth in that claim...still, even in your default state, you wouldn't find me shying away from showing a similar level of care..." Even if it was a smaller rump, like what Artoria, Fenrir, or even Circe possessed, Vahn simply liked to touch butts. He enjoyed the springy sensation and the feel of the soft flesh as it deformed under his touch. It seemed more intimate than fondling breasts as he would either have the woman sitting in his lap or laying down like what Nobunaga was doing. In the previous example, Vahn would often make out with his partner while, in the latter, he got to enjoy their bashful response as they peered at him with glazed and heated expressions...</p><p>After hearing Vahn's words, Nobunaga seemed to fall into thought for a brief moment before a veritable pile of matchlock rifles began to appear before crashing to the floor. At the same time, though they never fired, Nobunaga began charging them up before dismissing them, cycling through this same process several tens of times per second as her body rapidly decreased in size. It didn't take a master detective to understand what she was up to but, other than slipping his fingers under her now loosened panties, Vahn made no attempt to stop her. Fortunately, she didn't take things too far and stopped on her own after shrinking to around 152cm, her 'default' height. This made her butt considerably smaller, to the point that it wasn't even comparable to her mature form, but Vahn kept true to his word as he lightly fondled the mochi-like mound of flesh that fit pretty snuggly in his palm...</p><p>Without saying anything to try and justify her actions, Nobunaga just relaxed her head against the sofa's cushions, letting Vahn do whatever he wanted. She didn't even bother to adjust her clothing to something that fit her new form better, causing her tank-top to become several sizes too large while even her stockings became baggy and easy to slide up and down. Her hips had decreased by more than ten centimeters, going from a rather plump 86cm down to a 'modest' 75cm, around the same size as Artoria. As a result, her blood-red panties seemed far too big for her, even though the elastic band prevented from sliding off too easily. Regardless, Vahn was able to slide his hand under the fabric with ease, massaging Nobunaga's butt directly until she eventually dozed off nearly twenty minutes later...</p><p>---</p><p>After making sure Nobunaga was snuggly wrapped up in a blanket, a process that caused her wake up and roll her eyes, Vahn left her room behind, her unique fragrance and warmth still lingering on his hands. He didn't want their relationship to reach the point where being alone together equated to them having sex with each other. Before their first time together, Vahn had been more interested in being Nobunaga's friend than ever becoming her lover. Though he enjoyed the way she behaved when they were alone, he wanted her to keep her strong and independent personality without being 'completely' tamed by his actions. With that in mind, Vahn wondered if it would be better for their lasting partnership if he summoned a Heroic Spirit that Nobunaga was familiar with. This would give her someone to talk to as, after Astolfo left the Manor, Nobunaga had become a bit of a loner since she didn't mesh well with the other girls.</p><p>Sensing that Artoria, Gray, and Lakshmibai were all still together, this time in the latter's room, Vahn was once again tempted to go spend time with them. He had already told Gray that Paracelsus had agreed to join his organization so they had plenty to talk about without things having to 'devolve' into having sex. At the same time, however, Vahn felt like he would be impeding on their 'girl time', something he had learned was very important even in the Record of Danmachi. Loki had taught him that it was inconsiderate to just show up when girls he had slept with were talking in private. The moment he entered the room, most conversations would immediately derail, essentially making him the center of attention since all the girls would automatically assume he had come there for a very 'specific' reason.</p><p>Not wanting to complicate their growing friendship, as it was sometimes necessary to have a bit of distance from each other, Vahn decided to act on his original intentions by leaving the Sub-Space Orb entirely. Though only around fifty minutes had passed in the real world, that was more than enough time for Rin and Sakura to have vacated the bath. He could imagine that Circe was either keeping herself busy in the kitchen or lingering around in the hallway, literally waiting for him to make an appearance. When he appeared in the basement, Vahn could even sense a small magical formation trigger while, through his domain, he was aware of Circe moving around quickly through the Manor's interior...</p><p>Seeing how she was behaving, Vahn felt it was about time for him to treat her matter 'seriously' in order to avoid future troubles. It had been a long time since he went all-out in providing his services so this was a good opportunity to test the limits of his abilities. She was a Demi-Goddess so, even with her joke-like Strength, Circe should be able to tolerate things well beyond the limit of normal humans. Even if she practically pounced on him as a result, Vahn was already prepared to make good on his promise to prevent things from crossing the line. Hopefully, once she realized exactly what he could do for her, Circe would calm down considerably and actually start trying to get along with the others.</p><p>Shortly after leaving the basement, Vahn held up his hand to create a small wind barrier that caused Circe to giggle playfully as she let it push her back. She had been waiting around the corner to try and surprise him, concealing her presence to test the limits of Vahn's perception. His claim of being able to sense everything going on within 4km was something she wanted to put to the test in the near future. She wanted to know if he could 'see' everything within that radius, or if he was just vaguely aware of things like magical power and the presence of living creatures. There were all kinds of different ways people could sense their surroundings, including her own method of tracing life without her established territory.</p><p>Knowing that Circe was analyzing him, Vahn produced a wry smile but, as he was already under heavy surveillance by Alaya, Akasha, and her unnamed subordinates, it didn't matter all that much that a Demi-Goddess was doing the same. Instead of letting it bother him too much, Vahn caused Circe to backstep a few times as she evaded his attempt to touch her waist and pick her up. She had a playful look on her face as she stuck out her tongue and said, "You can't just touch me whenever you'd like, you know~? It is the duty of men to pander to cute women, but it is our unique privilege to decide who can pamper us, and when...now, shall we put your mettle to the test, V-ahn~." Placing a heavy emphasis on the 'ahn' part of his name, resulting in it sounding like a sensual moan, Circe then turned around, shaking her tail feathers toward him before bolting through the hallway.</p><p>Shaking his head, Vahn slowly followed after her while taking note of where everyone else in the Manor was and what they were up to. He let his intent shift to Illya's room in the process, seeing the peculiar sight of Fenrir and a transformed Illya with their paws together, legs tucked underneath their bodies in a seiza position. His 'peeping' didn't go unnoticed by them, causing both girls' ears to twitch as Fenrir turned her head towards where his intent was located, asking, "Master~?" Though this wasn't a unique occurrence, the fact that Cath Palug tilted its head to the side and repeated, "Master...?" was a bit of a surprise. He couldn't actually hear what they were saying, but the mouth movements were identical and he could easily read both girls' lips. In response to this, Fenrir turned her attention back to Cath Palug, saying something Vahn couldn't interpret as he moved his intent away from the room to leave the two to their own devices...</p><p>After finding Rin and Sakura reading together in the study, bringing a smile to his face since the two were seated together on the sofa, Vahn stopped peeking around as he tried to open the door to the bathroom. A small magical formation glowed on the handle, causing a small electrical shock to pass through his hand but, after having his body literally torn apart by Scáthach, such things had virtually no effect on him. He knew this was just another way in which Circe was trying to rile him up, taking advantage of the fact that most men would want to get 'even' in response to such pranks. This was also her way of getting revenge against him for the fact he had locked her in the room previously, causing Vahn to smile as he quickly erased the magical circle with relative ease.</p><p>Hearing the door open much sooner than she expected, Circe turned to look over her shoulder, mild surprise in her eyes as she commented, "I didn't think you would be able to break through so soon. Did you really want to watch me undress so badly...?" Circe had been in the process of removing the pale-gold accessories that decorated her arms, neck, and her left thigh. Though she could remove them with her ability to change her outfit in an instant, her reasoning wasn't all that dissimilar to why Vahn would sometimes undress normally. It was a sensual and intimate way to appeal to the other party, something Vahn appreciated greatly whenever the girls would give him a strip-tease or let him watch them dress...</p><p>Stroking his chin, Vahn made no attempt to conceal his intrigue as he answered, "I'll admit that I'm curious how your clothes are able to automatically obstruct a person's view...as for the contents, well, I won't say I'm not interested...hmmm..." Though he was intending to show Circe how 'professional' he could be, they hadn't officially started so Vahn felt like teasing her a bit. She seemed to be willing to play along, wiggling her butt toward him as she asked, "Do you really want to see~? I might let you if you get down on all fours and try to take a peek..." In response to this, Vahn just crossed his arms before leaning back against the door and watching in silence, an appreciative smile on his face.</p><p>Allowing a small blush to touch her cheeks, Circe wiggled her ears towards Vahn before making a show of removing each of her accessories as slow as possible. Without her platform-sandals, Circe looked significantly more petite than normal as her wings tucked inward to block the view of her backside. Though she had tail feathers that extended from the winged attachment, they didn't extend past her hips so Circe had to rely on the tips of her wings as she peeled away her short skirt and peek back at Vahn with large eyes and a coquettish smile. When he made eye contact with her, Circe shifted her wings slightly, briefly revealing her pert white butt for only a fraction of a second. Vahn, however, kept looking into her eyes without letting his gaze wander as, within his mind, he could already 'perfectly' imagine Circe's body without having to gawk...</p><p>Seeing that Vahn had been able to resist her small test, Circe bashfully batted her eyes a few times before unfastening the golden clasp that kept her thin tunic in place. Then, by simply slumping her shoulders slightly, the fabric fell to the ground after sliding down her arms in a smooth motion. With this, Circe was completely naked, bar the exception of her winged tiara and attachment that seemed permanently affixed to her body.</p><p>Now bereft of clothing, Circe opened her eyes to stare back at Vahn once again, this time causing him to squint slightly since her irises, which had previously been a perfect division between pink and green, were now entirely suffused with a deep and captivatingly pink. At the same moment their eyes met, an intoxicatingly sweet aroma spread throughout the room in an instant as Circe asked, "Do. You. Want. To. See~?" Then, without waiting for Vahn's answer, Circe slowly turned her body around, using her wings to conceal her shoulders and breasts while her hands were the only thing concealing her secret garden, the source of the smell that made Vahn body steadily heat up, at least until his body completely filtered the effect...</p><p>Instead of answering Circe with words, Vahn simply smiled to her in response, a reaction that caused her to blink in surprise as her ears waggled slightly. Then, as a smile spread across her face, Circe slowly opened her wings to reveal two snowy white mounds that could easily fit into the palm of one's hand. There were two pale pink protrusions at the very center, only a few shades darker than Circe's fair skin. Vahn's smile widened in response to this, causing Circe's ears to begin a steady metronome as she removed one of her hands aside before taking nearly a full minute to slowly move aside the other. The moment Vahn caught sight of the delicate peach-like mound, his brows furrowed slightly as he noticed the small mark glowing right above the tightly closed and tender looking slit...</p><p>Understanding that Vahn had seen her 'secret', even though his eyes hadn't looked directly toward it, Circe explained in a voice that seemed to directly tickle his brain, "This teenie-tiny mark is the core of my Magical Power. It's cute, isn't it~?" As she said this, Circe used her index finger to trace around the mark which, from Vahn's perspective, wasn't all that dissimilar to the crest he had carved into thousands of Elves. Circe actually seemed to 'refine' Magical Power within her womb, serving as a secondary reserve tank that was far purer than the normal mana flowing through her Magic Circuits. What confused Vahn was how he had nerved noticed the tiny pink 'sun' located within her womb as it contained a phenomenal amount of mana that even made him feel slightly threatened. The fact that the crest on the outside took the shape of an intricately designed pink heart didn't to much to abate the mild shock he felt knowing Circe 'hid' so much power in her tiny frame...</p><p>As if to further entice him, Circe's finger continued lower until she was less than a centimeter from touching the pristine and tightly closed divide of her vulva. She knew Vahn was paying attention as she licked her lips and stated in an almost hypnotic voice, "For the descendents of Hecate, we are not only fated to lose our powers during intercourse...but we are also guaranteed to get pregnant. At the same time, our lives become bound to our partner, granting them our lost power in exchange for giving us the right to take their lives whenever we wish...haaaa..." At the very end of her words, Circe let her finger descend just a bit lower before pressing it, ever so slowly, into herself...</p><p>Though it was certainly a sight to behold, Vahn actually recovered his senses faster the more Circe tried to entice him. The more effort she put into trying to charm him, the greater his resistance to the attempt became as both his mind and body adapted to the invasive energy. This didn't seem to deter Circe all that much, however, as her face had a rather excited smile as she looked directly at him while touching herself. Her ears had peculiarly pointed upward at a thirty-degree angle as she leaned forward slightly and began to breathe heavily through her button-like nose. Vahn knew she was getting off on being watched, knowing he wouldn't do anything to her, or at least confident she could stop him if he tried...</p><p>Deciding things would go on forever if he let Circe just do whatever she wanted, Vahn pulled out a massage table from his Inventory, startling her slightly as she released a tiny 'Eep~!' in response. Her hand immediately retracted from fiddling with herself as she flitted a few centimeters off the ground before realizing Vahn wasn't trying anything. Then, after patting her own chest to calm down, Circe complained, "You shouldn't startle a girl like that...!" In response to this, Vahn gave a light chuckle before adding in an amused tone, "And you shouldn't be playing with yourself while someone is watching...now come, hop up on this table. From here on, I'll give you a taste of what you can expect if you behave properly in the future..."</p><p>Hearing Vahn's words and seeing how quickly he had recovered caused Circe to puff out her cheeks adorably as she glared back at him with a look of blame in her pink eyes. As always, however, this didn't last long before she made a 'buuuu~' sound and shimmied over to the massage table. She titled her head a few times to observe it, wiggling her butt around to try and draw Vahn's eye before ultimately climbing on as instructed. Since there were small indentations for her face and breasts, Circe laid down on her stomach before noticing that the small stands that folded up from the sides were used to prop up her wings. Vahn had quickly set up a few things while she couldn't really see what he was doing, causing Circe's heart to beat rapidly in her chest as her tail feathers and butt twitched about in expectation...</p><p>Seeing Circe's actions, Vahn was momentarily reminded of Nobunaga's small butt, an errant thought that didn't escape Circe's notice as her body almost immediately turned statuesque. Then, as if her head was on a mechanical pivot, Circe looked back at him and asked, "You are thinking about other girls when I'm laying on a table naked in front of you...?" As she asked this, the color in her eyes shifted from pink to solid green, allowing Vahn to understand he could probably determine her mood based on the color of her eyes. At the same time, understanding he couldn't really gloss over the matter, Vahn nodded his head before unceremoniously resting his hand on her backside as he answered, "Don't worry, your butt is more adorable...its shape and feel are quite nice as well..."</p><p>Like a gradient switch had been flipped, Circe's eyes shifted back to pink but, at the very bottom, there was still a hint of green as she asked, "Who were you thinking about~?" This time, Vahn didn't bother to answer her question since he knew it was a landmine to humor that line of discussion. She wasn't even paying attention to the fact that he had been fondling her butt so Vahn set his right hand on her back and said, "You should stay focused as well. Don't worry, I won't let my mind stay a second time..." With that said, Vahn began to send threads of Source Energy into Circe's body as his hands danced across her back, lightly pressing each of her pressure points along the way. Though she still seemed to want an answer from him, Circe eventually put her face back into the hole on the table, setting aside the matter until later. What she didn't expect was, by the time Vahn was finished with her, thoughts of vengeance would be the last thing on her mind...</p><p>(A/N: Alternate Titles: 'Nobu-chan has fallen harder than Lakshmibai xD','Fenrir's educational methods...?','Omae Wa Mou Kawaigatta...!!!*You are already petted*')</p><p>https://bit.ly/2XBzAYu &lt;-(p.atreon link)</p><p>paypal.me/Einlion</p><p>Discord Invite: https://discord.gg/mn5xMbE</p></main><div class="link-group"><a class="btn" href="01108.html">Previous</a><a class="btn" href="../index.html">Table of Contents</a><a class="btn" href="01110.html">Next</a></div></div><div class="right-icon theme"><input type="image" id="themeButton" src="https://i.imgur.com/PWAzExk.png" height="25"></div><div id="readpos">0%</div><script src="../js/theme.js"></script></body></html>
