<p>Rather than using Alaya's Space Transfer ability, Vahn, Lakshmibai, and Kenshin exited the Avalonian sub-texture through one of its actual gates. There were four such points still active, three of which were located throughout the British Isles, the most famous of which, Stonehenge, even served as a tourist destination. Though Vahn planned to visit and secure each of these sites in the future, as the last thing he needed was someone managing to trace them back to Avalon, Merlin had told him it wasn't necessary to worry about such things.</p><p>This time around, Vahn used a gateway connected to the Ballynoe Stone Circle in Northern Ireland, as it was the closest point to New York while being the furthest from the Clock Tower. Fortunately, the stone circle existed near a loosely populated hamlet, significantly reducing the chances of them being discovered. Though most humans weren't able to perceive the phenomenon of Magecraft, it would cause a stir if they suddenly appeared out of thin air while a tour was going on.</p><p>With the outside world being in the midst of a very cold winter, Vahn wasn't surprised to find that the site was completely empty. This allowed them to store away their [Invisibility Cloak]s, provided by Da Vinci after he allowed her to analyze the blueprints for the [Helm of Darkness]. Though it was impossible to perfectly replicate the function of items designed for use in Danmachi, just knowing it was possible allowed Da Vinci to develop a similar artifact. As for why she decided on a cloak over a helmet, this was due to the fact most people, especially women, weren't comfortable with wearing burdensome objects on and around their heads. It was far more comfortable to wear a cloak, which actually took less magical power due to the field being localized around the cloak instead of the entire body, Da Vinci's version was a considerable upgrade to the original design.</p><p>After enjoying the scenic landscape for a few moments, Vahn gave a nod towards Lakshmibai and Kenshin before they all seemingly vanished from view. This was accompanied by the sound of three shockwaves, causing a pulse of energy to spread across the snow-covered fields as they moved at supersonic speeds towards the ocean. Even though she was on the slower side of the Servants that had been summoned, Lakshmibai could manage a pace of around 1,500km/h without overtaxing her reserves too much. This increased their travel time to nearly four hours but, as running across the surface of the ocean was quite an interesting experience, Vahn didn't mind it all that much.</p><p>What Vahn didn't expect was, after traveling for nearly two hours, they came across a large patch in the ocean that was completely covered in garbage. At first, he didn't pay much attention to it but, as they continued onward, the crisp blue ocean waters became murky and, as far as the eye could see, a veritable ocean of trash existed. This caused him to develop a deep frown, something he shared with his two companions. Lakshmibai even covered her nose due to the smell and, with the patch of garbage seemingly extending for several hundred kilometers, Vahn used his Telekinesis to elevate them above the waters to get some fresh air.</p><p>Seeing the large patch of trash covering the surface of the ocean, Vahn couldn't help but grind his teeth as, during the journey leading up to this discovery, he had been in rather high spirits. Since his conversation with Vivian was still fresh on his mind, Vahn saw this as another way in which humans corrupted the world around them. There was such a large volume of waste and debris caught in the ocean current that the surrounding waters were filled with toxins and chemicals, killing most ocean life in the immediate vicinity.</p><p>Taking the words out of his mouth, Lakshmibai commented, "This is terrible...why doesn't anyone clean this area? How could they let things develop to this extent..!?" Though Lakshmibai had been born in the midst of the industrial revolution, it hadn't hit her small Kingdom by the time of her death. She knew about the massive factories that blackened the skies of Europe for a time but, now that she saw the consequences of humanity's consumption and waste, Lakshmibai felt more than a little shaken.</p><p>As he didn't have a real answer to her questions, Vahn just shook his head before saying in a serious tone of voice, "This is just another thing we must change in the future..." It was easy to lay the blame on many groups and organizations but, having already decided that his Empire would reign supreme over the entire world, it didn't really matter. He would bring the matter to Da Vinci's attention before they worked to come up with a solution to the problem. Then, in the future they wished to create, he would make sure a similar incident never repeated.</p><p>By the time he had flown the group over the patch, Vahn had estimated its size to be around 400km across, with its northern and southern bounds a mystery. He could fly around the entire region to get a grasp of its actual size but, feeling this would only make him angrier, Vahn elected not to. The next time he traveled to this region, it would be to remove the veritable island of garbage, restoring the ocean's natural beauty and breathing new life into the previously polluted ecosystem...</p><p>No longer in the mood to enjoy the ocean's beauty, Vahn brought their journey to an early end by accelerating through the sky at around 2500km/h. He could go even faster but, as this would cause his grasp on the two to slip, especially with Lakshmibai's [Magic Resistance:A], making it very difficult to hold onto her, Vahn needed to pace himself. Though he could have just carried her directly, which she undoubtedly would have enjoyed, he was worried it would affect both of their state of mind. For the time being, she was supposed to be acting as his escort and, after the lectures he had received from Artoria, Vahn decided not to play around too much when he was in the outside world.</p><p>With a red String of Fate guiding his way, Vahn didn't have to worry about getting lost over the ocean so, after an hour of flight time, they could see land approaching. At the same time, the waters below were dotted with ocean-faring vessels, increasing in traffic as they moved closer to shore. To evade observation, the group had already dawned their cloaks. All three noticed long ago that the density of mana in the air had decreased rapidly as they approached land but, with both Lakshmibai and Kenshin possessing a [Goddess' Divine Core] and [Divinity] respectively, their reserves wouldn't be adversely affected. At this point, they were also outfitted with accessories that allowed them to replenish their reserves more easily but, if necessary, he was more than willing to help them out...</p><p>Since it was hard not to notice, Vahn didn't directly head inland as seeing a large green statue of a woman was quite the sight to behold. As his two companions were also somewhat interested in it, they hovered around the small island for a few minutes, taking pictures with a portable camera. He had promised Sakura that he would bring back souvenirs so, to alleviate his dour mood from before, Vahn didn't mind a few detours. Though the city smelled extremely foul, with heavy pollution ruining much of the enjoyment that he otherwise would have had, Vahn did his best not to mind it as the group ventured into Manhattan before touching down in Central Park.</p><p>As they had passed by the building, Vahn discovered that Luvia was staying in a large luxury Hotel known simply as The Plaza. It overlooked the Central Park Zoo but, with the rampant sound pollution that plagued the entire City, Vahn imagined the noise caused by the animals was negligible. It was easy to imagine that most of the buildings in the area had potent sound-proofing as well, though Luvia would obviously have been able to manage regardless.</p><p>Unexpectedly, Kenshin had a glimmer in her eyes as she looked towards the Zoo but, understanding her duty, she didn't comment on it. Vahn, however, smiled in response to her behavior, remarking, "I already told everyone we might be gone for a few days. If you want to visit the Zoo later, we can go as a group. I also wouldn't mind taking you out for a date, though it will have to wait..." Since it was already dark outside, the Zoo had already ceased operations for the day. Though they could easily break in, Vahn didn't feel like gaining a few points of negative Karma just to trespass a place they could visit freely later on.</p><p>Hearing Vahn's words, Kenshin had a radiant smile on her face as she happily chimed, "Thank you, Your Majesty. I would happily accompany you anywhere~." Then, as if her smile had been an illusion, Kenshin looked around the area, her senses taking in the surroundings as she looked for any signs of danger. This rapid change caused Vahn to lightly chuckle as, at his side, Lakshmibai tugged at his sleeve before saying, "I would also like to go...Your Majesty..."</p><p>Extending his hand to rub Lakshmibai's head, Vahn answered lightheartedly, "Of course...", eliciting a smile in response. Then, taking advantage of the surrounding tree cover and the lack of pedestrians, the group removed their cloaks. Though they still stood out quite a bit, as Kenshin and Lakshmibai had changed into evening gowns that gave them an appearance similar to actual Goddesses, it was better to be high-profile openly than draw attention to themselves by acting shady. As for Vahn, he changed into a fitted Edelgarde business suit, the name of a luxury clothing brand owned by the Edelfelt family. It would retail at close to $320,000 and, as Loki and Fortuna had taught him that it was important to always dress the part, Vahn felt this was a good substitute for armor amongst the members of the Upper Class.</p><p>As could be expected, the trio a lot of attention after emerging from Central Park, with the main focus obviously on the two inordinately beautiful women. White and sand-colored hair were both very rare in the United States and, with styles extending past the hips and to the ankles being even rarer. Since Kenshin even had a monochromatic style, with the underside being pitch black, it only drew even more attention, especially with the three black markings on the center and sides of her bangs. She looked like a movie star that had just left the set while Lakshmibai, wearing a white dress that exposed her back and shoulders, despite the cold, practically radiated a regal aura and high-class aura.</p><p>Ignoring most of the people gawking at them, the trio made their way towards the entrance of The Plaza. Along the way, Vahn had to destroy a few cell phones and cameras, as he didn't appreciate anyone trying to take pictures of the girls' backsides, but that was something he did passively at this point. Fortunately, there wasn't anyone foolish enough to try and approach them, even though a young businessman looked like he had been frozen in time after getting a glance at the two. He was just standing in place after exiting a reinforced black Lincoln, his escorts showing slight concern as they urged him towards the interior.</p><p>In any other situation, the youth, aged around twenty-seven according to Vahn's casual glance, would have tried to strike a conversation with the two Goddesses. At the very least, he would have wanted to include them as part of his social network but, with Vahn radiating an oppressive aura, any attempt he made to walk forward felt like trying to climb a mountain with another mountain on top of him. During the brief moment when Vahn had turned his eyes toward him, any will he had to try and approach the two girls had been quashed in an instant. He felt like a tiny ant standing before a large African Elephant, especially after seeing the expensive suit Vahn was wearing...</p><p>When passing through the entrance, the security personnel and Valets made no attempt to bar them entry, despite the fact it generally required a reservation just to enter the premises. Being in their line of business, they were intimately familiar with the ins and outs of high-society. When they saw how well dressed the three were, combined with how they carried themselves, they understood trying to inconvenience the group would have potentially disastrous consequences. At the very least, it was apparent that Vahn had the financial clout to easily foot the additional fee for impromptu bookings. There was also a chance that he was the guest of a VIP and, considering who they were entertaining at the moment, none of them wanted to be caught in the firing line.</p><p>After entering the building, which wasn't all that impressive from the outside, Vahn was more than a little surprised by how high-quality everything in the interior was. He didn't let this show on his face, however, as the quality of the Ivory Castle made this Luxury Hotel seem more like a hovel. Instead, he was listening to the conversation of the security personnel, some wondering about his identity while others, belonging to Luvia's forces, had already alerted her to his presence. One of them had even contacted an interior liaison who, speaking through the earpiece worn by the women standing at the reception desk, told them to be very respectful before the group even approached.</p><p>Taking her role as his Herald rather seriously, Kenshin tried to step forward to handle things but, as neither she nor Lakshmibai had any form of identification, he held her back by creating a membrane of invisible pressure. She didn't show any discernible signs of alertness and instead slowed her pace slightly so that she was in step with Vahn. This allowed Vahn to be at the center of the group as he smiled towards a rather tall woman with amber-colored hair tied into a neat bun. She already had a respectful look on her face as she stated, "Lady Edelfelt has already been informed of your arrival, Your Majesty. Please, if there is anything we can do to make your wait more enjoyable, all of our staff are ready and willing to assist you."</p><p>Vahn was slightly surprised by the fact the woman had addressed him as 'Your Majesty' but, without showing it on his face, he gave a curt nod, answering, "Thank you for your hospitality." Then, seeing a few familiar faces depart the nearby elevator, Vahn waited patiently for the group to approach him, maintaining his smile as they bowed and exclaimed, "Your Majesty, please allow us to escort you." As the leader of their group was someone he had been introduced to directly, Vahn gestured for them to raise their heads before answering, "Very well. I will be in your care, Miss Mayweather."</p><p>Though it hadn't been that long since their last meeting, Sophia felt her heart tremble at the fact that Vahn had remembered her name. She had been the leader of the security forces charged with the protection of Rin in the past and, as her group had previously attacked Vahn, she was always nervous around him. Even then, she didn't allow it to show on her face and, if not for their inhuman perception, Vahn, Lakshmibai, and Kenshin would have been none the wiser. Instead, they all had knowing smiles on their faces as the red-headed beauty guided them towards the elevator, a group of six other security personnel escorting them.</p><p>Using a golden key, Sophia unlocked a panel within the elevator before pinning in a key code that allowed access to the appropriately titled Royal Suite. Though it would cost upwards of $70,000 a night in normal circumstances, the company that owned the Hotel was a subsidiary group belonging to a branch of Edelfelt Holdings. This meant Luvia could stay whenever she wanted without having to pay a penny. Rather than take advantage of this, however, Luvia compensated the staff by giving exorbitant tips to cover any inconveniences she might cause during her stay.</p><p>After a smooth and virtually silent ride, so quiet that Vahn could hear the heartbeats of the security personnel, the elevator opened to a foyer of sorts. Immediately after that, apparently unable to wait even a moment longer, Luvia was already flying toward him like a bolt of golden lightning as she shouted, "Vaaaahn~!" He dutifully caught her out of the air, allowing Luvia to grip his head like a vice before she began to passionately kiss him, completely disregarding everyone else in the elevator. As if they had already expected this, however, none of the group's expressions changed in the slightest as they dutifully exited the elevator and set out to assist in other tasks.</p><p>It took several minutes but, with Vahn's persistent 'efforts', Luvia eventually released her hold on his face, her own suffused with a red hue as she stated in a serious tone, "I missed you." In response to this, Vahn gave her butt one final squeeze, causing her to clench her teeth slightly as he answered, "I missed you too, Luvia. There is a lot we need to talk about. I hope I didn't interrupt anything."</p><p>Releasing a peal of laughter in response to his remark, Luvia began to rub her head against his chest as she explained, "I'm almost finished up with everything I needed to take care of. I was going to be flying back to London in the next two or three days. It makes me happy that you came all this way for me~." Then, after looking between Lakshmibai and Kenshin once, Luvia gave Vahn one more kiss before releasing his neck and returning to the ground. She had been hanging off of him previously, allowing her ample bosom to press into Vahn as he unabashedly supported her by firmly placing his hands on her plush posterior.</p><p>After setting down, Luvia pulled Vahn by his hand towards the large double-doors which had already been pulled open by two security guards. Vahn could see Siegfried standing in a statuesque manner at the side, matching the ornate art pieces with his immaculately carved figure. He gave a courteous bow the moment Vahn looked toward him before raising his head and smiling. This would have been a commendable display of etiquette, if not for the fact he was cradling a somewhat fat black cat in his left arm. It was clear that Susu had been making the most of her time away from Avalon, putting on a bit of weight after being freed from her stress-filled existence. She still managed to lazily open her eyes and, after seeing Vahn, released an admittedly adorable meow that made it hard to blame her...</p><p>(A/N: Alternate Titles: 'Zoom zoom','Literal garbage as far as the eye can see...','Susu has become a fat cat (UwU)...')</p><p>https://bit.ly/2XBzAYu &lt;-(p.atreon link)</p><p>paypal.me/Einlion</p><p>Discord Invite: https://discord.gg/mn5xMbE</p></main><div class="link-group"><a class="btn" href="01218.html">Previous</a><a class="btn" href="../index.html">Table of Contents</a><a class="btn" href="01220.html">Next</a></div></div><div class="right-icon theme"><input type="image" id="themeButton" src="https://i.imgur.com/PWAzExk.png" height="25"></div><div id="readpos">0%</div><script src="../js/theme.js"></script></body></html>
