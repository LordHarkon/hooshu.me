<p>Vahn couldn't help but feel very odd about trying to comfort two girls simultaneously, at least with two different bodies. However, he had wanted to console the crying Lili without making Naaza feel like she was being set aside as an observer. Thus, while gently stroking Lili's back, he was simultaneously hugging Naaza from behind. It was a little awkward, as her tail was wiggling near his hips in a dangerous location, but it didn't matter much since things would develop that way regardless. Naaza herself seemed to be very aware of this as well since her aura was slowly transitioning from a sunny yellow with strands of pink, into a more rosy pink that was tinged with a passionate red.</p><p>Lili was in a very similar state, as she had started to calm down very quickly when he kneeled down to hug her. Even though she was currently in her Pallum state, Lili smelling around the base of his neck and hair while enjoying his comforting embrace. She could see the other Vahn hugging Naaza at the side so Lili decided that she would stop holding back herself. Though they were the same person, the Vahn that was hugging her made Lili feel somewhat possessive and she could feel an aching feeling in her body that had been slumbering for a long time. Now, it had completely awoken and the only thing that was preventing her from treating that ache was her own mental state. She just needed to calm down and get into the mood so that the first part of her dream could become a reality...</p><p>...</p><p>...</p><p>Though she could feel her body heating up, Lili discovered she didn't have the courage to make that final push, at least not on her own. It was very comfortable to be held by Vahn and, as a result of her earlier reminiscence, Lili felt like she would spoil the mood if she pushed forward selfishly. There were 'a lot' of things she had been looking forward to trying with Vahn, to the point where nary a night passed without her dreaming about it. Now, however, Lili felt a great deal of hesitation because she was worried Vahn would think she was 'weird' for having so much interest in sex, even though they had never even done anything yet...</p><p>Lili felt like her thoughts had become very tumultuous, mixing together like a chaotic sea that threatened to swallow her up. However, the stable existence that was holding onto her kept her from falling into that deep abyss and, when she heard a peculiar sound reach her ears, Lili regained her senses. Looking over, she saw that Naaza and Vahn had started kissing each other and, even though it wasn't that noticeable at first, Lili could feel 'her' Vahn reacting. Realizing that Naaza had gotten an advantage against her, and that the Vahn comforting her was getting a rise out of that, made Lili feel a strange...resentment.</p><p>The last vestiges of her hesitation loosed their grasp on her mind as Lili began to nuzzle into Vahn's neck, saying, "Today is my birthday...is it okay to be a little selfish...?" Hearing this, Vahn blinked in surprise while trying to ignore the reaction of his other body. After thinking for a brief moment, Vahn smiled and said, "Sure, Lili, today is your special day...as long as it isn't too difficult, I'll grant you any request..." Lili gave him a kiss on the cheek that lasted a few seconds before she happily smiled and addressed his other self and Naaza, "Naaza...I changed my mind. I don't mind if we both have sex with Vahn at the same time, but seeing two versions of Vahn makes me feel a little awkward. I think we should use different rooms, at least for the time being..."</p><p>While she was speaking, Lili apologized to her best friend within her mind since her words weren't entirely true. In actuality, Lili felt like monopolizing Vahn for a bit and was also feeling a little competitive towards her friend. She wanted to take Vahn into a private area and see if she could get a bigger rise out of him than Naaza. Knowing her actions would make things 'difficult' for the other Vahn made Lili feel strangely excited. At least for today, she wanted to be able to act as selfishly as she wanted...</p><p>Naaza, unaware of what was going through Lili's mind, broke free from her kiss with Vahn before nodding after a bit of hesitation. She suddenly felt even more nervous, knowing that she wouldn't have a friend to rely on if she got scared, but decided it was probably for the best. After all, she had never been the kind to enjoy public displays of affection and, though she didn't mind being around Lili, Naaza was afraid she would embarrass herself greatly in the heat of the moment. Because she was a Chienthrope, her sex might be a little awkward and Naaza was afraid her image in the eyes of the other girls would break down if she acted without restraint...</p><p>Unlike Naaza, Vahn was completely aware that Lili was up to something but, as he had already given her permission to act selfishly, he decided to go with the flow. It would have been considerably more difficult to be in the same room as himself anyways so Vahn figured it was better this way. This would also be the first time he was with two different girls at once, so it was also a very important practical experiment that he needed to treat seriously. Since he would feel ashamed of himself if he couldn't make both girls happy, Vahn was determined to do his best in both rooms...</p><p>Staying with Naaza in her room, as she was more comfortable there, Vahn also accompanied Lili to his room. He then erected barriers and sound-proofing wards for privacy purposes while Naaza began to fidget about and Lili made her way over to his bed. By the time he was finished, Lili then said, "This will be my first time...but I also want it to be a first for you, Vahn. I know you're worried about the differences in our size, but I don't want you to treat me differently than the other girls, at least not in the way you might think..." Hearing this, Vahn was somewhat confused as he turned to Lili, seeing her sitting on the bed while averting her eyes away from his.</p><p>When she peeked over and saw the confusion on his face, Lili smiled in an unexpectedly mischevious manner as she explained, "Everyone is aware of it, and I'm sure you've also realized...but, you have a habit of eyeing girls that have unique and exotic features. It's so obvious that, when I tried seducing you in the past, I used my [Cinder*Ella] to try and take advantage of your inclination. Since you're also drawn to cute things, I had hoped you would eventually give in if I kept trying...ehehe~."</p><p>Vahn recalled all the times Lili had transformed in the past, taking on traits of Chienthropes, Cat People, Elves, Weretigers, and even Vanargandrs. Her racial magic, [Cinder*Ella], was a horrifyingly 'effective' skill against someone like him. Though he had never gone over the line, Vahn knew he had let Lili get away with a lot more than he should have. He also knew that, as she claimed, he had a bad habit of being drawn towards unique and particularly exotic women. Every time he saw a girl from a different race, Vahn couldn't help but think about what it would be like to be with them...</p><p>Seeing the understanding in Vahn's eyes, Lili giggled while repositioning her body atop the bed. She turned her rear towards him, revealing the stark white panties she had worn today. Vahn's eyes flashed towards the rather dangerous looking sight as a magical light flashed over Lili's body. He had wondered why she wore a skirt today, as she usually wore shorts, but now it made perfect sense as he watched a black and white tiger tail pop out of Lili's backside. Her forearms, hands, calves, and feet all became covered in fur while small pink paw pads appeared on her fingers, palms, and the soles of her feet. Lili's previously chestnut-brown hair became white as tiny tiger-ears appeared on her head. Looking back, Lili revealed her stark blue eyes as she grinned with a strangely predatory look and said, "I wanted to become the girl that made you stop looking at other girls...I can be anything you want me to be, Vahn..." And then, in a voice only she could hear, Lili muttered, "...as long as you don't mind my size..."</p><p>Lili had made a similar offer in the past but, as she was still too young for such things, Vahn had dismissed it as her being mischevious. Now, however, he became somewhat curious about the extent of Lili's transformation abilities. He had already experienced that there were certain 'unique' traits possessed by girls of different races. If Lili's body truly emulated the racial traits of whatever she transformed into...she had just become a somewhat dangerous existence to him. As she implied, his curiosity towards other girls could actually be addressed by her if she could emulate their characteristics. The only downside was, as Lili's size was still that of a Pallum, it actually made her seem 'more' dangerous when she was transformed. After all, Lili was only 110cm tall and, unless he shrunk down, Vahn was currently 175cm in height...the disparity in their sizes had always made him uncomfortable...</p><p>As if she knew what he was thinking about, Lili furrowed her brows and turned around until she was standing her knees. With a very serious expression, that made her actions seem somewhat peculiar, Lili lifted up her skirt to reveal the white-lace panties she was wearing. Then, in a firm tone, Lili stated, "Vahn...I'm not a child...stop treating me like one just because I'm a Pallum. Today, I'll show you exactly how much of an adult I am. Even if you're more experienced than me, I'm confident I'll be able to satisfy you. In fact, I want to become the girl that can satisfy you the most! And it's not just because I feel like I owe you anything, it's because that is what 'I' want! Having to wait for the last year has given me too much time to think about things and now I want to try them all...!"</p><p>Vahn watched Lili closely and listened to all of her words, to the point that his body in the other room had experienced a momentary pause. Naaza gave him a curious expression but Vahn just smiled and explained, "Lili just made quite the...confession...sorry about that." Stroking her head and ears, Vahn continued to cuddle up with Naaza while looking to Lili and saying, "I won't lie to you, Lili...I'm actually somewhat afraid of you." When she heard this, Lili's eyes widened into saucers and she had a very confused expression on her face until Vahn explained, "You see, even though I tell myself it's okay, because you are a Pallum, I can't help but be worried by the differences in our size. If you were able to take on the traits of other races, that actually makes me more terrified, because I'm afraid it will skew my preferences a great deal..."</p><p>Lili opened and closed her mouth a few times while the confident light in her eyes began to waver slightly. With how things were progressing, it was almost like Vahn was telling her that he 'couldn't' be with her. However, this wasn't the case as Vahn followed up his words by saying, "However, none of that really matters anymore. Though I'll likely never get over my inhibitions, I'll bear such things willingly if it means I can make one of the 'women' I care about happy. Even if you didn't want to become someone irreplaceable to me, I don't think I would be able to let you go in the future...so, sorry if I'm also a little selfish at times..." Vahn sent Lili a playful wink, causing her to release a powerful sigh of relief as her body lost strength.</p><p>Ultimately, Vahn knew Lili wasn't a child and the only thing he needed to do to avoid looking at young girls with 'intent' was to simply not be a scumbag. He was perfectly fine around girls like Tina, Shizune, and his own daughters, and Vahn was confident this would always be the case. Even Lefiya, though extremely adorable, didn't get the same rise out of him as more mature girls. Vahn wasn't going to hold Lili responsible for his inhibitions about her size and, as she was now an adult, he would work through them to make sure she was happy.</p><p>Lili might awaken something inside of him that should probably stay sleeping, but he had been fine even after having a long-term physical relationship with someone like Eva. There was also Sis, always watching over his every action, and she would undoubtedly 'correct' him if he did anything strange. In response to this thought, Sis' voice very firmly stated, (*You're damn right, Vahn. I won't let you become some sexual deviant. I made an exception for Eva, but so help me if you tried something...*) Even though Sis didn't have a real body, Vahn couldn't help but awkwardly swallow while both Lili and Naaza gave him curious looks...</p><p>Vahn shook his head lightly to ease the awkwardness he was feeling while walking over the bed and crawling in front of Lili. She was no longer holding her skirt up but Vahn still felt she looked absolutely adorable right now with her tiny tiger ears. However, that kind of thing could wait for later so he reached out and began stroking her face and ears while saying, "You should return back to your true form for the time being. I understand you might have a lot of fantasies you'd like fulfilled, but that can wait until you're more comfortable with the 'normal' methods first..." This time, Lili's face flushed and she began to take audible breaths as a magical light caused her false-Báihǔ features to fade away.</p><p>Seeing Lili in her natural form, Vahn's smile softened and, though she looked like the momentum was beginning to get to her, he leaned down and gave her a kiss on her small and supple lips. Her tiny tongue intertwined with his as he continued to stroke his fingers through her hair and trace his thumbs along her ears. This continued for several minutes until he pulled away, smiling at Lili's red face as the trail of saliva between their lips severed. She swallowed hard and said, "You've never kissed me like that before...it was...nice..." Though they had kissed several times in the past, Vahn always held back a bit since he didn't want to 'trigger' her too hard. Now, however, the only thing holding him back was the fact he was busy in two different rooms simultaneously.</p><p>Cradling her face, Vahn noticed that Lili's cheeks were kind of squishy to the touch, causing a smile to spread across his face as he said, "There are two ways we can go about this...you can leave it to me, and I'll try to make things as comfortable for you as possible...or you can take the lead and go at your own pace. What will you choose, Lili...?" The whole point of him using two bodies was to make his own actions somewhat awkward and 'amateurish' to give Naaza and Lili a more memorable first time. However, this didn't mean he was really helpless and, if he put in the effort, Vahn would be able to 'take care' of both girls rather easily...</p><p>Lili paused for several seconds, contemplating between the two different choices before a resolute light began to shine in her eyes. After giving a small nod, Lili said, "Lay down...I want to do thing my own way. I don't want you to take my first time...I want to give it to you." Vahn smiled, ruffled Lili's hair, and then moved to the headboard of his bed and laid down on his back. Lili seemed to be psyching herself up and, when she was ready, made her way over to him. She unbuttoned the top two buttons of her blouse and began to crawl up his legs in a slow and seductive manner. Vahn could feel his heart begin to beat quickly as a 'panic' spread through his mind at how 'dangerous' a sight the small girl crawling up his legs presented...</p><p>Understanding his reaction, Lili felt a little frustrated but also gratified that Vahn didn't actually take any action to stop her. It bothered her that he was still concerned about the size of her body but, at the same time, Lili understood why someone like Vahn would be concerned. Even so, she wasn't going to back down at all, especially since she knew he wasn't going to either. Thus, without any real hesitation, Lili straddled the bump in Vahn's trousers. She immediately felt the giddy feeling in her heart compound greatly and couldn't help but bite her top lips as she lightly moved her hips before releasing a hot sigh. It felt like nothing stood in her way anymore, a strangely liberating feeling that Lili had never really expected to experience.</p><p>Licking her lips, Lili looked into Vahn's eyes while her passionate red aura crawled over his body, clinging to him in a possessive manner that Vahn had gotten used to with other girls. As if she realized this, Lili's eyes squinted and she moved her hips lightly as she asked, "We haven't done much yet...but how does it feel...any different from other girls~?" Vahn knew exactly what Lili was talking about and, though he was somewhat hesitant, he nodded his head and explained, "It's...kind of squishy..." Lili laughed mischievously with her eyes squinting further as she asked, "How can you be so certain...? You haven't touched it directly yet..." Lili reached under her skirt and pulled the two neatly tied ribbons at the side of her panties. She had been wearing rather exotic side-tie lace panties that looked even more dangerous with their pristine white coloration.</p><p>After pulling away the fabric, Lili lowered her hips again, releasing a hot sight while spreading the panties she held, saying, "Look what you did to me...Vahn~." At the center of the delicate fabric, there was a very visible wet spot that had covered nearly the entire protective region. Vahn felt an itchy feeling in his heart as Lili laughed and said, "I want you to keep these as a memento...I bought them especially for today and it would make me happy knowing you always had them with you~." Lili placed the fabric into his hands with a mischevious light in her eyes, smiling radiantly when she saw the cloth disappear. Then, she once again moved her hips gently and asked, "So...can you feel any difference~?"</p><p>At this point, Vahn realized Lili was completely triggered and, though it wasn't unexpected, she seemed to have the type of personality that liked to tease people. He didn't mind communication during sex, as it could make things a lot more interesting, but it was beginning to get a little difficult. In the other room, he had already started having sex with Naaza and he was certain Lili had realized it from his reaction. Still, as he had decided to play along with her, Vahn clenched his teeth lightly before saying, "It is very warm...more than normal..." Lili nodded her head as if she had expected the answer, following up his words by saying, "Yes, Pallums are known to have a higher body heat than most races...people say its because our bodies are so tiny..."</p><p>Vahn swallowed his saliva again, causing Lili to smile while biting her top lip. The love nectar that had previously been kept at bay by her panties had already soaked into his trousers and Vahn was tempted to throw them into his Inventory. If not for the fact he 'knew' it was better to treat a girl's first time in a normal manner, Vahn would have already discarded his clothing long ago. Fortunately, it seemed like Lili was already reaching the limits of her own tolerance as her body began to lightly tremble. A much larger volume of liquid spread through his crotch as Lili made squeaking moans while supporting herself with her hands against his stomach.</p><p>Lili had decided to warm up her own body by getting off on Vahn's before they began. She knew he was very good at foreplay but decided to take matters into her own hand since moments like this weren't something that came often. However, she made a mistake and a feeling of dread spread through her as she muttered, "No...damnit..." Vahn was curious about what was wrong, tilting his head slightly while asking, "Lili...?" However, instead of getting an answer from her mouth, Vahn discovered the source of her unease the moment he asked the question. For the second time today, for entirely different reasons, Vahn got to experience the peculiar feeling of having a small girl pee on him...</p><p>(A/N: I know I'm not the only one that is a little bothered by Lili's size so, if you want to avoid the next chapter, I would understand. Still, keep in mind that she is, in accordance with the canon material, legally and adult. Chalk it up to the pitfalls of a fantasy world created with a child-like slave race (x__x)...)</p><p>A/N: Alternate Titles: '*BANG* *BANG* *BANG* FBI!
