<p>Though he also felt awkward by the situation, Vahn's training with Sc√°thach and the persistent influence of his [Will of the Emperor] gave him an almost unperturbable disposition. Thus, despite Da Vinci's laughter and Olga's stammering, he kept a relatively calm demeanor as he casually mused, "Forgive me, Olga. It was not my intention to expose you to such a...compromising predicament." As he said this, Vahn gave Da Vinci a sidelong gaze, a flicker flashing across his eyes that brought her laughter to a quick end. She poked her tongue out at him in response before walking over to Olga's side, causing the latter to tense up before both she and Vahn were surprised when Da Vinci gave her backside a loud 'thwap'.</p><p>With her face even redder than before, Olga rubbed her butt with an aggrieved expression as she exclaimed, "Ow! What was that for...!?" Since Da Vinci had a Strength parameter of 17D, it meant she was around seventeen times stronger than the average adult. As a result, even though she didn't put too much force into the hit, Olga still teared up a bit as her butt throbbed painfully. She had never been spanked in her entire life so, despite the fact she had just witnessed something 'amazing', Olga couldn't help glaring at Da Vinci while frowning deeply.</p><p>Ignoring Olga's glare, Da Vinci opened and closed her hand a few times before remarking, "Not bad. You've been exercising, haven't you~?" Though she knew this as a result of the data collected by the Companions, Da Vinci felt like teasing Olga since the latter had disturbed her fun with Vahn. As a result, Olga's blush had started to creep down her neck as her eyes wandered around the Workshop. She briefly cast her gaze at Vahn, causing her heart to beat even faster as she stopped rubbing her butt and murmured, "You're a bully..." while glaring at Da Vinci.</p><p>Hearing Olga's words, Da Vinci couldn't help giggling as she gestured toward the scanning bed. This caused Olga to reluctantly make her way over but, as her butt was still tender, she didn't sit on the table directly.</p><p>Before Olga could think of anything to say, Da Vinci caused her body to stand ramrod straight as she poked the tender portion of her butt and asked, "Did I really hit you that hard? Do you want me to get Master to rub it for you~?"</p><p>Olga began to fluster but, as if her question never required an answer, Da Vinci had already started pulling Vahn over to the table. This caused the latter to furrow his brows and, feeling that Da Vinci was still scatterbrained due to their earlier antics, he decided to put his foot down. Rather than rub Olga's butt, Vahn reached out his hand to the top of her head, sending a wave of healing energy into her body as he explained, "Don't let Da Vinci rile you up too much." Then, turning his gaze to the chibi version of his lover, Vahn sternly stated, "You should go calm down...I'll watch over the scan."</p><p>Rolling her eye playfully in response to Vahn's words, Da Vinci 'skipped' out of the room, wanting to use the systems in her private workshop to scan her body. She knew not to push things too far but, coming down from the earlier excitement wasn't easy. Though she didn't blame Olga for showing up on time, as it obviously wasn't her fault, that didn't mean she felt any better about the situation. Her body still craved intimacy and, despite the fact she had changed forms, Da Vinci could feel Vahn's energy wreaking havoc, making a mess of both her mind and undergarments...</p><p>As could be expected, Olga became even more nervous after Da Vinci left the room as, with just her and Vahn, her mind began racing to match the beating of her heart. She looked like a terrified little rabbit and, as a result of Da Vinci's pheromones still influencing him, Vahn had to focus just to avoid pushing her down. Fortunately, though it was considerably less effective when used on himself, Vahn was able to send calming energy into his own body while gently stroking Olga's head.</p><p>Just as Vahn was beginning to calm down, confident a disaster had been avoided, Olga apparently decided to ignore his efforts as she sheepishly asked, "W-why were you naked...?" Though the subtle aroma in the Workshop already provided her with the answer, it was the way Da Vinci reacted to her presence that cemented the truth in Olga's mind. Even she didn't know why she decided to ask Vahn what he was doing but, as the words had already left her mouth, she nervously looked up, expecting some kind of excuse...</p><p>While wondering if Olga was trying to rile him up, or if it was just her natural 'peculiarity' that caused her to ask such a question, Vahn did his best to appear calm and casual, honestly answering, "Da Vinci and I were having sex. She wanted a baby and I wanted to give her one..." As he said this, Vahn removed his hand from Olga's head as, unless he intended to pet her into 'oblivion', she was already too far gone to calm down at the moment...</p><p>Having never expected Vahn to answer honestly, Olga's mind momentarily blanked and, for several seconds, she even forgot to breathe. Then, though her first instinct was to exclaim in embarrassment, she followed Vahn's example of being calm, her face turning dangerously scarlet as she lowered her head and muttered, "I-I see...yes, that makes sense...hahaha..." Though she had not intended to, Olga couldn't help but glance towards Vahn's belt, causing a shiver to run up her back as she remembered the spectacle she had previously witnessed. As a Magus, she obviously knew the anatomy of humans very well but, seeing Vahn's naked body had left a much deeper impression on her than any of the books she had read...</p><p>Feeling that he would go crazy and 'eat' the sheepish rabbit boring a hole into his trousers, Vahn startled Olga by lightly patting her shoulder and saying, "Take a seat...". This caused her to flinch and, if not for the fact he had his hand on her shoulder, Olga might have even jumped in surprise. Even then, she managed to follow his instructions and, with her butt no longer tender from Da Vinci's slap, Olga had no trouble sitting on the table. Though she was fidgetting around a bit, this wasn't too much of a problem as Vahn quickly performed the calibration operation on the scanning bed before leaving the rest to Ark.</p><p>With the familiar mechanical arm coming to the front of her face, Olga was actually able to calm down a bit, even though she had a somewhat melancholic expression. Though she didn't know what she expected, it was clear that Vahn had no intention of taking 'advantage' of her. Thus, as her Magic Crest appeared on her head, she began to relax a bit, at least until she looked back into Vahn's calm and 'stupidly' handsome face. Seeing him acting naturally caused her to feel a slight frustration but, as Vahn was quick to pick up on this, he just smiled in response before asking, "How has your work been going? I believe you are currently on your fifth Quest...?"</p><p>Though she briefly puffed out her cheeks in response, Olga ultimately released a slightly heated sigh as she answered, "That Quest Board and the Skill Tree are both incomprehensibly useful. I can't even begin to wrap my head around how they work but it has certainly made things much easier..." As she had even been able to increase her [Astronomy] from B to A-Rank, Olga felt like she had made more progress in the few months she spent in her Magus Tower than the last few years at the Clock Tower. To further cement this, she now had a completely unique form of Magecraft that wasn't taught, even in families that specialized in researching the stars...</p><p>While nodding his head in affirmation, Vahn pulled a chair of thin air to take a seat, an action that caused Olga to quickly adjust her skirt as she tightly closed her legs. Since she was seated on a table, there was a small chance he would be able to see between the gap of her legs, causing Vahn to feel a strong urge to roll his eyes Instead, he decided to continue the conversation while focusing on Olga's face, stating, "If you need any help, don't be afraid to ask. I may be..." Though he wanted to say more, Olga surprised him by shaking her head and, with a somewhat sad look deep in her eyes, saying, "It is fine...I understand that His Majesty is busy with other things. I will continue to do my best..."</p><p>Vahn felt taken aback by Olga's sudden change, at least until she followed it up by adding, "If I work hard...please praise me a lot...". Though she actively sought praise, this was the first time that Olga directly made her expectations known. Since she spent the most time with Fenrir, Lakshmibai, and Iris, it seemed like their supportive nature had brought about some small changes. This brought a smile to Vahn's face and, without needing to embellish things, he simply stated, "Of course. I believe in you, Olga..."</p><p>---</p><p>Though the atmosphere remained tense and awkward, especially when Da Vinci returned to work on other projects, Vahn and Olga were able to have a long and friendly conversation. By the end of it, Olga had calmed down considerably and, though she would often become red in the face, talking about her research was an easy way to get her to open up. The only time things really got awkward was when Olga, with easy to discern intentions, 'accidentally' allowed the tension in her legs to relax with the passage of time. As a result, though she was wearing pantyhose, it was still possible to see the white fabric of her panties through the garment. Though he didn't directly look, Vahn's mind did slip up at one point, alerting Olga to the fact he had 'peeked' and causing her face to turn red as she did her best to continue the conversation...</p><p>When the 'lasers' finished scanning Olga's Magic Crest, the complex magic circle slowly faded away from her forehead as Ark's results appeared on the screen. Though the structure had already been analyzed long ago, Olga had still been showing up for her scheduled appointments as there were a few anomalous sections of the Magic Crest that Da Vinci wanted to observe over time. Fortunately, even after several scans had been performed, there were currently no signs of any 'demons' within the Animusphere Magic Crest, at least for the time being.</p><p>With the scan completed, Olga hopped off the table and, standing awkwardly close while also trying to keep a bit of distance, she leaned next to his body to read the information panel. As it was her family's Magic Crest, Olga had obviously been privy to the data collected and, as compensation for her troubles, Da Vinci had promised to replicate the Magic Crest so that their family would have two in the future. This was rather significant as, with the exception of perhaps two families, every other major lineage only had a single successor per generation. As a result, there was often infighting and competition between the young generations of a Magus family, to the point that 'failures' were even sacrificed as material research in the most extreme cases...</p><p>Though Vahn wasn't the type to get flustered over such things, feeling Olga's warmth and having her 'bump' into him with the softer parts of her body caused him to inhale a little deeper than normal. It was obvious she was pushing her luck and, despite the fact she likely wasn't ready for such things, Olga was like a newborn lamb facing down a lion. She was very embarrassed and somewhat anxious but, rather than fear and trepidation, there was more expectation and curiosity. He could even feel her heartbeat through the subtle and almost indiscernible vibrations in the air as she pretended to be oblivious to the fact she was almost leaning against him...</p><p>Feeling that it was too dangerous to stay in the same room as Da Vinci, as her aroma and periodic glances would rile him up a fair amount, Vahn decided it was time to leave. At the same time, he was considering teaching Olga a lesson and, depending on how she reacted, there was a fair chance her expectations might be met. He knew how hard she had been working and, seeing the progress she had made, Vahn was very tempted to 'reward' her with more than simple praise. Though it wasn't wrong to say these thoughts only existed as a result of his earlier interactions with Da Vinci, Gray, and Artoria, Vahn couldn't deny he found Olga's inexperienced temptations amusing.</p><p>Lightly nudging her breasts with his shoulder, Vahn rose to his feet while causing Olga to take a few steps back, her face turning a few shades redder. Then, feeling his body heat up, Vahn looked toward Da Vinci to find her staring at him with a mischevious expression before she returned to her work. It only took a simple glance from her to trigger the effects of her [Mesmerizing Gaze] and, throughout the conversation with Olga, she would periodically look over just to 'tease' him. She was doing this intentionally and, though he knew it was likely her intention, Vahn decided he would 'punish' her the next time he visited the Workshop. Since she had spanked Olga, he could deduce that she was also interested in the 'play', causing Vahn to make a mental note to that effect.</p><p>Before Da Vinci could rile him up any further, Vahn turned his attention back to Olga, adopting the calmest smile he could manage as he asked, "Shall we go? If you'd like, I can escort you back to the Magus Tower. If you want to rest, I can also take you back to your room...?" Vahn decided to pass the potato to Olga this time around, seeing what she would decide. He would let her push him a bit this time, giving her the freedom to choose her own fate. If she decided to go alone, Vahn wouldn't put any pressure on her but, having been riled up, Da Vinci's fate would essentially be sealed. Either that or he would go spend a bit of time with Circe as, after his earlier discussion, Vahn felt he was on a warpath of sorts...</p><p>As she was already prone to jumping to conclusions, Olga read 'more' into Vahn's offer than would have otherwise made any sense to. This time, however, she didn't understand that she was walking into the dragon's den as she turned her eyes up at him and answered, "I'd like that...if it isn't too much trouble, please escort me back to my Magus Tower, Your Majesty. The evenings may be long in Avalon, but I do not want to waste starlight..." Though she would indeed return to her work in most instances, Olga still had some small expectations that, with them being alone, 'something' might happen...</p><p>Inhaling somewhat audibly, Vahn retained a casual smile on his face as he extended his arm for Olga to grab. Then, after giving Da Vinci a curt nod and a 'warning' look, eliciting a giggle in response, the two left the Workshop, walking nearly thirty minutes to reach Olga's Magus Tower. During this time period, Vahn made the usual small talk while allowing Olga to take a few liberties with his arm but, going against her 'actual' expectations, he didn't immediately try to leave after reaching the Tower. Instead, Vahn escorted her inside rather than separating at the entrance's threshold, causing Olga's heart to begin racing, something he was very aware of as it directly transmitted to his body.</p><p>Believing that he was curious about her work, Olga began to fumble about as she tried to keep calm. Vahn decided to play along with her and, as her work was genuinely very interesting, he listened to her explanations until she calmed down. It was at this moment that he decided to strike and, as she had talked about her progress earlier, Vahn gave an approving smile as he remarked, "You have been doing very well, Olga. I'm impressed with how much progress you've made..." This was enough to elicit a happy smile from the pale-haired woman, something that caused Vahn's own to curl up at the sides as she stated, "O-Of course! I am a genius, you know~?"</p><p>With Olga puffing her chest out with pride, Vahn squinted his eyes slightly before nodding his head and asking, "Shall I check it directly...?" This question momentarily confused Olga but, as Vahn lightly touched her back, his intent became very clear. As a result, her face became scarlet and, though she had exposed her body to have the Familia Crest carved, Lakshmibai had been present for support</p><p>Understanding that Olga's mind was racing, Vahn decided to give her a small push while also leaving her a way out as he asked, "Should I retrieve Lakshmibai...or perhaps Iris?" As there was little to no chance he would do anything 'untoward' in the presence of the latter, Vahn left Olga with an option that was inarguably 'safe'. He actually was curious about the progress she had made and, though it would depend on Olga from then onward, it was an easy excuse to get the bashful woman to strip.</p><p>Though her mind was still racing, Olga felt comforted by the realization that she had a way out of her current predicament. At the same time, this gave her a bit of confidence and, believing that Vahn would never force her if she asked him to stop, she ultimately decided to push her luck. Thus, with her heart beating madly, and her blood pressure making her feel a little lightheaded, Olga took a deep breath as she touched the small gemstone near the collar of her blouse. Though her body started to tremble instantly, she adjusted her clothes so that she was wearing a backless swimsuit, even though her original intention was to change into her lingerie...</p><p>With Olga suddenly wearing a rather sporty white swimsuit, Vahn's brows perked up a bit, causing her to cough a few times to cover her embarrassment as she answered, "That will be unnecessary. I do not want to trouble anyone...besides...I...I trust you..." Though part of her wanted Vahn to 'betray' her trust, Olga felt secure in the knowledge that he wasn't the despicable man her delusions would sometimes lead her to believe. As a result, she stood up nervously, allowing her slim yet full figure to be visible as she walked over to the small bed she used for napping. Her body was shaking madly but, after she plopped face down on the bed, Olga was able to calm herself down as she listened to Vahn's approach...</p><p>Vahn was able to perfectly image a person in his mind but, seeing the figure of Olga as she walked away from him was a sight to behold. Though the clothes produced by the [REquip] system always fit perfectly, the swimsuit she was wearing cut into the soft areas of her body, causing the eyes to naturally wander. It was because of this that Olga's body trembled as, even though he wasn't thinking any 'bad' thoughts, Vahn unabashedly admired her beauty. She might struggle to compare to some of the other women in the castle, but she would still stand out quite a bit amongst the vast majority of people in the world.</p><p>After Olga plopped down on the bed, completely hiding her face from view, Vahn made his way over with a natural gait. When he had first placed the Familia Crest on her back, Olga had been sitting in a chair so, whether she understood her own actions or not, the fact she had decided to lay on her bed was akin to an open invitation. He felt she was a bit ditzy at times like this but, having decided to teach her a lesson, Vahn caused Olga to turn statuesque as he climbed into the bed and straddled her hips from behind. Her brain didn't seem to process what was happening until she could feel his weight against her thighs but, before she was able to 'complain', Vahn already cut his finger, drawing a line of blood down her back.</p><p>As Olga's body began to tremble even more than before, albeit without doing anything to stop him, Vahn observed her Status coming into view. She actually had made quite a bit of progress and, with her unique [Constellation] Magecraft, Vahn smiled as he honestly admitted, "You have really come a long way, Olga...I'm proud of you..." This caused much of her trembling to stop outright and, after a few seconds of silence, Olga looked back at him. She couldn't come up with a response but, with the look in her eyes alone, Vahn could tell that his praise had left a meaningful impact on her. Now that she was looking at him, however, Vahn knew it was his time to strike so, while matching her gaze, he allowed his palm to run along her back, tracing down to her pert rump as he said, "I know you have trouble expressing yourself...you also allow your mind to run away with thoughts...this time, let me meet your expectations in a different way..."</p><p>Though Olga tensed up at the contact, something that caused Vahn's slumbering dragon to twitch in response, she made no effort to stop him. Instead, she showed a complicated expression on her face as her eyes began to dart around in their sockets. Ultimately, however, she just swallowed hard and, without saying anything, buried her face into her pillow. He could feel her body shaking beneath him but, as he didn't plan to push her 'that' far, Vahn decided it was time for Olga to experience why he had the nickname 'Godhand'. With that in mind, though he appreciated the softness of Olga's butt for a little longer than he ought to, Vahn fundamentally changed the nature of her future delusions by showing her pleasures and comforts her mind had never imagined...</p><p>-------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p>[Status]</p><p>Name: [Olga Marie Asmleit Animusphere]</p><p>Age: 22</p><p>Race: Human, God(sealed)</p><p>Strength: 2E-&gt;3E</p><p>Endurance: 4E-&gt;7E</p><p>Agility: 2E-&gt;3E</p><p>Magical Power: 3E-&gt;11D</p><p>Good Luck: 4E-&gt;37B</p><p>Circuit Quality: 20C</p><p>Noble Phantasm: ?</p><p>Origin: Star, Time</p><p>Skills: [Priestess of Celestial Bodies:Innate:C],[Star of Misfortune:Innate:(sealed)]-&gt;[Beacon of Prosperity:Innate:E], [Charisma:D-], [Eidetic Memory:D], [Mathematician:A], [Pianist:B], [Singing:C]</p><p>Magic: (-)</p><p>Magecraft: [Od Conversion:C], [Conversion:C], [Astronomy:B-&gt;A], [Prophecy:C], [Constellation:E], [Catalyze:D], [Reinforce:D-&gt;C], [Curse:D], [Magic Coat:C], [Gandr:B], [Restoration:E-&gt;D], [Familiar:E-&gt;D], [Projection:E], [Alchemy:C]</p><p>[Mathematician]</p><p>Rank: A</p><p>Use: Denotes a mastery of mathematical theory and the user's comprehension of advanced formulas.</p><p>[Pianist]</p><p>Rank: B</p><p>Use: The user's skill when playing the piano.
