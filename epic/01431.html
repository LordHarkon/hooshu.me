<p>Though he was separate from the massive giantess by both Space and Time, Vahn could still feel the overwhelming pressure radiating from her body. It was like being pressed down, not by a mountain, but an entire planet. She was even looking directly at him, but, considering he always saw the visions from his point of view, this wasn't too surprising. What did surprise him, however, was that the giant woman vaguely resembled Altera, alluding to the fact they were intrinsically related to each other...</p><p>Just as this thought crossed his mind, Vahn was broken from his reverie as Altera inquisitively asked, "Master...?". It was obvious she still expected an answer to her previous question, but, due to the size and presence of the peculiar giantess, Vahn's thought processes had temporarily stalled. He knew he would be encountering the actual giantess in the near future, but, for the moment, he had the duty of helping guide Altera onto a less destructive path.</p><p>Understanding she was referring to herself when she asked if there was a purpose to a weapon that couldn't destroy, Vahn smiled sagely as he explained, "The purpose of a weapon depends primarily on two factors...the person wielding it and the will of the weapon itself. Weapons may be used to cause destruction, but, in the hands of those who desire to protect, it can be used to preserve, and, even create, life. In the hands of a true master, a sword can be used to sever sickness, destroy curses, or even alter the flow of fate. Destruction can be achieved through various means, often without the use of an actual weapon, so, in a way, it is the least unique way in which a weapon can be used..."</p><p>To emphasize his point, Vahn removed his hand from Altera's head, waving it through the air around them to cause a ripple within the void. As a result, one of the large pillars developed massive cracks and, a moment later, it began to collapse under the strain of fragmented Space. Though it could be argued as weaponizing the Laws themselves, Altera would end up falling into his trap if she were to point it out. After all, while capable of immense destruction, the Laws existed to give structure and form to all things. It was up to the user to determine how they were used, but, no matter how great their mastery, the purpose of the Laws remained unchanged...and infinite.</p><p>Though she didn't understand the meaning behind her Master's words, this was nothing new, so, after a brief moment of reflection, Altera asked, "What is my purpose...? My impulses tell me to destroy, but, everyone else tells me this is a bad thing. This makes me feel lost and confused...I don't understand why it is bad to destroy bad things? Tell me, Master, why do you get to destroy as you please? Why must I restrain my impulses when there are bad things happening and enemies waiting for a chance to destroy me? Wouldn't it be better to destroy civilization and be rid of everyone that can do us harm...?"</p><p>Based on Altera's line of questioning, it was easy to see she had been putting a lot of thought into this, perhaps since the time of her summoning. Though he felt it was a little strange for her to ask him these questions just as he was about to head off to the Moon Cell, the flow of fate around her indicated it was instigated by something he had done. Unfortunately, he couldn't see into the past, nor could he know how other people influenced the world around them without direct intervention.</p><p>Since Altera seemed to be basing her reasoning around his actions, Vahn spent a moment sorting his thoughts before answering, "There is no easy answer to your questions, Altera...objectively, the only thing that allows me to act with impunity is the power I wield. However, if I were to truly act without consideration for others, I would never be happy. I would find myself alone, as, even if I was able to make people fear and respect me, they would never open their hearts to me. Without these kinds of bonds, people begin to feel empty inside, and, after a while, everything else seems to simply lose its meaning...tell me, Altera, is there truly nothing you care about beyond destruction?"</p><p>Hearing her Master's words, Altera only felt greater confusion, but, hearing his final question, she adopted a complicated expression before muttering, "I like having my head pat...I also like the taste of sweet foods...the apples grown in the hills are my favorite..."</p><p>Though it was a little awkward to hear Altera prioritize head pats over other things, Vahn nodded his head in affirmation before asking, "These things, would they exist if they were destroyed...?"</p><p>As she had never actually thought about it before, Altera couldn't help but frown when she heard her Master's words. If someone wanted to destroy the things she liked, she would destroy them first, so, with a resolute look on her face she said, "I see...you destroy things to protect other things and let them grow..."</p><p>Vahn's smile turned slightly awry when he heard Altera's remark, his hand plopping on her head as he explained in an exasperated tone, "It is more important to create and build than it is to destroy. If people always resorting to destroying things, the orchards wouldn't even exist. Though other apple trees might be found elsewhere, they wouldn't have the same quality. The apples you enjoy are the result of several people spending countless hours cultivating and caring for them...while your desire to 'protect' them is not wrong, you wouldn't have anything to protect without building it up in the first place..."</p><p>Hearing her Master's words, Altera fell into deep thought for several tense seconds before simply replying with her characteristic, "I see..." in her usual monotone.</p><p>Despite her affirmation, Vahn had the distinct impression that Altera hadn't actually understood what he was trying to convey. She was the type that understood things better if they were shown directly, rather than explained. Thus, after sorting through his thoughts, Vahn said, "I will assign both of you a new mission..."</p><p>The moment these words left his mouth, both Okita and Altera became more attentive, their gazes focused as they awaited his orders. This was a habit he wanted to break, but, as it was convenient at times like this, Vahn gave a small nod before explaining, "Once I return, I will teach you how to grow and care for various plants and animals. Your mission will be to work alongside each other to create a garden filled with life. When you are finished, it will become a private place where only the people you have chosen may enter...also, for every unique plant and animal you properly care for, I will give you a suitable reward...the more difficult the endeavor, the greater the reward I will bestow..."</p><p>Though neither Altera nor Okita understood the real purpose behind their Master's words, it didn't actually matter. To them, his orders were absolute, so, while they had no particular interest in animal husbandry or gardening, they were determined to complete their mission. This was something that Vahn was very aware of, so, while it was a bit 'cheap' on his part, it was worth taking advantage of their nature if it meant they learned something important...</p><p>---</p><p>Since Okita's clothing had already repaired itself, Vahn decided it was best to let them get an early start, so, after exiting the [Training Orb], he took them to visit Iris. She was the best option when it came to teaching the taciturn duo, as, during Artoria's attempts to get Altera to fit in, the latter had spent a few months acting as Iris' escort and personal attendant. The hope was that Iris would be a good influence on her, but, in spite of her efforts, Altera remained largely unchanged.</p><p>After entering the Library, where Iris still dutifully carried out her responsibilities, Vahn raised his hand in greeting as the woman in question brightened up at his arrival. When she saw who was with him, however, she adopted a false pout, muttering, "And here I was thinking you had stopped by to spend time with me...I'm going to tell Illya you're bullying me again..."</p><p>Though he was used to Iris' teasing, the hair on the back of Vahn's neck stood on end, as, the last time Iris had 'complained' to Illya, he ended up getting crushed by the latter after she spontaneously increased her size to around sixteen meters. This wasn't an intolerable weight, but, considering she had been naked at the time, Vahn nearly suffered a trauma as a result of her body greedily seeking him out, even in her overgrown form. Even Illya had panicked at the time, so, while it wasn't exactly likely, Vahn couldn't help but feel a little unnerved by the possibility an 'accident' would occur...</p><p>Since there were very few things that could make Vahn pale, Iris knew what he was thinking about. Her own smile became a little awkward before she made a point of loudly clearing her throat and asking, "What brings the three of you here? Did you need my advice on something...?"</p><p>In response to Iris' question, Vahn gestured to Altera and Okita, explaining, "If possible, I would like you to teach these two how to properly care for plants and animals. I'll prepare a private [Sub-Space Orb] here in the Library so you shouldn't be inconvenienced too much...can you do this for me, Iris?"</p><p>Hearing Vahn's request, Iris covered her mouth and issued a womanly giggle before answering, "But of course. In exchange, I expect you will build a small cottage or a villa within the orb, correct? Make sure there are at least five bedrooms, a large bath, and, as a precaution, a private area with adequate soundproofing~."</p><p>Vahn didn't have to ask why they would need a soundproof room within the private orb, as, despite her motherly nature, Iris had a few hidden sides only he and Illya knew about. Thus, without having to really think about it, Vahn nodded his head and said, "That shouldn't be a problem. I'll also install a large lake to serve as both a water source and a pool. Other than that, is there anything else you'll need...?"</p><p>Since it was hard not to get excited about a private residence, Iris spent several minutes throwing a bunch of random thoughts and ideas at Vahn. This caused him to sit across from her with a wry smile while, at his side, Altera and Okita just listened in silence. The only thing that mattered to them was the completion of their mission, but, with how excited Iris seemed to be, even Altera began to feel as though the garden they would be making was something 'special'. If not, it didn't make sense for Iris to be so excited about it, so, even if she didn't really understand the purpose of the mission she had been assigned, Altera began looking forward to it...just a little.</p><p>---</p><p>While his secondary vessel was dealing with the trio of white-haired women, Vahn's main vessel was holding counsel with Merlin, Artoria, Gray, Gawain, and, as she had been manifesting more often as of late, Alaya. They were discussing his upcoming assault on the moon, and, as it was an important topic for discussion, the giantess that had appeared when he tried to view his fate in relation to the flow around Altera.</p><p>Though she was unaware of anything happening beyond the planet's atmosphere, Alaya was still aware of the identity of the 'White Titan', a being denoted as Velber: 02 when using the same system that designated him as Type: Omega.</p><p>According to Alaya, Velber: 02 was an offshoot of an alien entity that appeared within the Sol System every 14,000 years. This being, a Rogue Star known as Velber, would station itself beyond the edge of the Oort Cloud, beyond the influence of Sol, and, after scanning the Surface of each planet, shed parts of itself with the intent to eliminate any and all life detected. It was for this reason that every planet, with the exception Gaia, appeared barren and lifeless.</p><p>Nearly thirteen-thousand-years prior, Velber had shed off three fragments of itself and, as a result, most life within the Sol System had been destroyed. The only reason there were any survivors at all was due to the intervention of Sol itself. After seeing the havoc a foreign star was causing, it's own fragments, the entities immortalized as Gods of the Sun, took the battle directly to the invaders.</p><p>Unfortunately, every planet beyond Gaia ended up becoming a victim in this relatively short war as, the further away from their parent star, the less power each God of the Sun possessed. It was for this reason that Velber positioned itself beyond the Oort Cloud, more than 15,000,000,000,000km away from Sol, well outside of its influence. There, it could freely harass the outer planets and, while it had ultimately been repelled, nearly all life within the Sol System had been lost in the process...</p><p>In the end, Gaia herself remained relatively unscathed, but, by the end of the battle, most of the first generation Gods had been completely wiped out. Velber: 02 and single-handedly wiped out nearly every pantheon and, if not for the sacrifice of Mars, the principal God of War for which the Roman God was named after, all life would have been lost. Even then, however, Velber: 02 was not actually killed, only repelled.</p><p>While all of this information was important, it was what Alaya explained next that really caught the attention of everyone in the room. According to the memories she had inherited from Gaia, the few remaining Gods gathered the blood and essence of Velber: 02, sealing it away within a human body in the hopes of using them as a weapon against subsequent invasions. Unfortunately, this would-be weapon was beyond their power to control, so, in their desperation, they ended up sealing her away, using an entire mountain range to keep her contained.</p><p>Ultimately, due to the shifting of tectonic plates and various other factors, this humanoid weapon was eventually discovered by a nomadic tribe known as the Huns. From that moment on, the legend of Attila the Hun and Etzel were born, two legends representing a warrior known as the embodiment of destruction. She had inherited the sword used to repel her original self, [Photon Ray], and, with it, she knew no equal on the battlefield. As a result, her tribe conquered much of the known world, and, if not for the betrayal of her last wife, Kriemhild, Siegfried's vengeful widow, she likely would have conquered Rome and prevented the rise of modern civilization in its entirety. Instead, she ended up manipulated in another woman's scheme for revenge, and, instead of losing her life honorably on the battlefield, Attila ended up choking on her own blood after suffering a brain hemorrhage...</p><p>(A/N: Alternate Titles: 'Those with innocent minds ask the hardest questions...','Illya and Iris are both scary...','</p></main><div class="link-group"><a class="btn" href="01430.html">Previous</a><a class="btn" href="index.html">Table of Contents</a><a class="btn" href="01432.html">Next</a></div></div><div id="readpos">0%</div></body></html>
