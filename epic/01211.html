<p>Shortly after Hecate had vanished from his sight, Vahn could feel a subtle ripple in the surrounding space, followed by the complete darkness he had been submerged in fading away. With the ritual complete, the surroundings returned to normal, well, as normal as they could be with a hundred lamb corpses dotting the area. Vahn didn't pay much attention to these, however, as his vision was dominated by the scene of Circe laying next to the now extinguished pyre. Compared to before, her presence was like a wispy flame compared to a tiny sun, indicative of the fact that she was now a 'normal' girl.</p><p>In less than a blink's time, Vahn was already kneeling next to Circe, his palm resting against her abdomen as he inspected her body for any sign of injuries. His 'scan' immediately brought to attention the two large scars on Circe's back, which, despite their attempt to 'resist' his treatment, were dealt with after a few minutes of concerted effort. Since Circe's own mana density was very low at the moment, albeit much higher than a normal human, it was easy to discern the invasive energy that had permeated through her body. Though he wouldn't have been able to easily discern what this energy entailed in the past, Vahn's studies related to [Curse] Magecraft gave him a good idea of what was going on.</p><p>With Circe physically, mentally, and spiritually drained, Vahn knew it would be dangerous to wake her up before she had rested properly. She would be in an extremely unstable state so, rather than guide her back towards consciousness, he instead lulled her into a much deeper sleep. Then, after setting up a powerful barrier around them, Vahn decided his time was best spent making sure there were no sequelae left in her body as a result of the powerful curse. Before that, he checked Circe's status within the Unit Management, wondering if her Status would offer him any useful information.</p><p>-------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p>[Status]</p><p>Name: [Circe]</p><p>Age: Ageless-&gt;2348</p><p>Race: Human(new), Nymph(sealed), God(sealed)</p><p>Strength: 2E-&gt;1E</p><p>Endurance: 31B-&gt;5E</p><p>Agility: 16D-&gt;2E</p><p>Magical Power: 50A++-&gt;13D</p><p>Good Luck: 49A+-&gt;50A+</p><p>Circuit Quality: 24C</p><p>Soul Tier: 3</p><p>Noble Phantasm: [Metabo Piglets: C-&gt;E]</p><p>Skills: [Phantasmal Chef:Innate:SS(sealed)], [Sun God's Descendant:Innate:A], [Blood Moon's Curse:Innate:D]-&gt;[Blessing of the Night Mother:Innate:(-)], [High-Speed Divine Words:B]-&gt;[N/A], [Poisoned Meal:A], [Advice for Sailing:A], [Territory Creation:B], [Item Construction:A]</p><p>Magic: [Helios's Divine Protection:SS]</p><p>Magecraft: [Mutagen:S]-&gt;[N/A], [Alchemy:B]-&gt;[N/A], [Herbology:B]-&gt;[N/A], [Refiining:B]-&gt;[N/A], [Addiction Enchantment:B]-&gt;[N/A]</p><p>-------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p>Seeing Circe's Status, Vahn was more than a little surprised but, rather than lamenting too long, he was actually more relieved than anything. Though her Od was a mess, her reserves weren't actually that low and, with a Magical Power of 13, she was still far stronger than even prodigious Magi. Since her Quest would afford her with 3,000,000VE, she would be able to quickly increase her strength once again. Fortunately, due to being a Servant summoned through the Throne of Heroes, Hecate's so-called 'blessing' had no effect on her Class Skills and those derived from her legend. As for her loss of [High-Speed Divine Words] and the reduced efficacy of her Noble Phantasm, these were both things that could be remedied with time and concerted effort on Circe's part.</p><p>With a better understanding of Circe's condition, Vahn spent the better part of an hour nourishing her body with his Source Energy while doing what he could to expel the 'curse' within her body. As it was derived from her own Innate, however, he didn't have too much luck driving it away. It was now an intrinsic part of her and, unless Circe was the one to change it, there was little he could do other than guide towards a better future. Curiously, her Good Luck had actually increased and, though it was subtle, there was now a discernible flow of fate, not simply around her body, but linking them together. Vahn knew he could 'sever' this thread without much difficulty but, fearing it would have disastrous consequences on Circe, he instead tried sending his own Source Energy through the aura to strengthen it...</p><p>Though he had some success in interacting with the aura of fate, Vahn wasn't able to discern any real changes in its structure or density. His comprehension of the Laws governing Fate were sub-par as, even with their massive power and pseudo-omniscience, Merlin and Sc√°thach were also unable to do anything to influence the flow of Fate. It was, perhaps, one of the most powerful manifestations of Law as, without Fate tying together certain individuals, the Record itself likely couldn't exist. After all, though the Record he inhabits may not be the version created by the original Creator, it was still brought into existence as an amalgamation of the hopes and dreams of an incalculable number of people, each believing in a certain story structure and chronology...</p><p>After doing everything he could to stabilize and strengthen Circe's body, excluding giving her a new one comprised of his Source Energy, Vahn wrapped her up in the two mantles that had been used as her bed and blanket. Even though his impression of Hecate wasn't that great, it was obvious that she cared rather deeply about Circe as, despite the fact the latter had 'betrayed' her teachings, most of the harm Circe had suffered seemed to be of her own creation.</p><p>Vahn could tell that the feathered mantle that was left behind was comprised of Circe's previous winged attachment, complete with the complex array of Magic Circuits on the interior. As for the fur cloak, Vahn was able to discern that it was a very powerful artifact as, despite his efforts, it resisted being placed into his Inventory. It also had a strong power flowing through it and, though it was far too big for Circe to wear normally, he could tell it was intended to protect her from harm.</p><p>Remembering Hecate's treatment towards him, Vahn couldn't help but produce a wry smile as, if he considered it from her perspective, he would probably lambast himself. It couldn't be easy seeing someone you cared about making a decision you didn't agree with, especially if they were in your care for a long period of time. If it were one of his children, or someone that had been close to him, Vahn knew he would probably react in an even more extreme manner. Thus, despite the fact he was extremely annoyed by Hecate's treatment, Vahn decided not to harp over it. He certainly couldn't say anything bad about her towards Circe as, if she didn't respect Hecate, she never would have gone through the Red Moon Ritual in the first place...</p><p>With this in mind, Vahn held Circe gingerly in his embrace as he flew through the air, his destination the Ivory Castle on the northern end of the island. It was a very short flight and, after a few twists and turns, Vahn quickly found himself in the Menagerie, despite the fact that Circe was, technically, just a normal human woman. Then, while waiting for her to wake up on her own, Vahn decided to keep her company as, if he wasn't here when she awoke, he could only imagine the duress she would feel.</p><p>Holding her light body in his embrace, separated only by the fur cloak, Vahn continued to nourish Circe's Magic Circuits with his Source Energy. Now that she didn't have her wings, it was very easy to hold her in his embrace so, for the better part of six hours, Vahn did just that. At the same time, he enjoyed the subtle and bittersweet fragrance of her air while closely observing her Status inside of his mind. He had already experienced marginal success with this method in the past but, with his ability to view her Status in real-time, Vahn wanted to see how quickly he could improve her Magic Power and Circuit Quality through the nourishment of his Source Energy...</p><p>Before he was able to make any progress, not that he expected immediate results, Medusa had returned from her etiquette lessons to take a rest. When she found them inside the Menagerie, her first reaction had been bubbly excitement but, feeling the peculiar atmosphere, she resisted the urge to pounce into the bed. Though Vahn had raised his head to give her a glance, he waited until she was near the side of the bed before whispering, "Circe made a big sacrifice tonight, Medusa. In the future, please take care of her when I'm not around..."</p><p>As they had already become relatively close over the last few months, Medusa furrowed her brows slightly, her expression becoming one of concern as she looked into the sleeping face of Circe. In response to her Master's words, she nodded her head in understanding, muttering, "I understand..." Then, without asking for permission, which wasn't exactly necessary considering it was her own bed, Medusa crawled under the blankets before grabbing Circe's hands. In this manner, Vahn and the silver-haired Gorgon sandwiched Circe from both sides, keeping her warm and bringing her comfort as she slowly extricated herself from the darkness of unconsciousness...</p><p>---</p><p>By the time Circe's eyelids began to flicker, she had already been asleep for nearly thirteen hours, during which time her Circuit Quality had actually increased from 24C-&gt;25C. Though he could help her increase it to the EX rating by providing her with a body, Vahn felt that Circe was in the same camp as women like Rin and Luvia, preferring their original flesh and blood over the 'convenience' of what amounted to an artificial body.</p><p>When her eyes peeled open, Circe's pupils were actually pale gold in color, a few shades lighter than Medusa's own. Since the latter was the first thing she saw after opening her eyes, Circe's heart began to beat in an anxious rhythm but, before she could jump to conclusions, Vahn made his presence known by holding her a little more firmly as he whispered, "I'm here...it's okay..." This caused Circe to tremble lightly and, causing Medusa to pout, just a little, she ignored the latter before wriggling around to face him. Vahn was able to see her new eye color for himself but, before he could say anything further, Circe gripped the sides of his face with what little strength she could manage as she began to kiss him rather passionately...</p><p>Despite the fact she was even weaker than before, and had just awoken from a long slumber, Circe didn't seem to care at all. The moment she saw Vahn, all of the emotions she had been bottled up for the last few months surface and, no longer holder herself back, she practically attacked him on the spot. This caught both Vahn and Medusa off guard, the latter letting her mouth hang agape as she suddenly felt like a third wheel. As for Vahn, he had no idea how someone with 1E Strength was able to muster up so much 'intensity' but, rather than push her away, he decided to reciprocate by holding her waist and allowing her to press herself against him.</p><p>Though she seemed to enjoy kissing quite a bit, Circe didn't seem satisfied with just this as, while they were interlocked with each other, she would periodically yank at his belt and trousers. Since Vahn felt things were going a little fast, he decided to take some initiative of his own, tracing his hands around her slender waist and back. Since she was just a relatively normal human at the moment, even these simple actions, when combined with his Petting Laws and [Hands of Nirvana] were enough to make her body go limp as she trembled against him. Then, after giving her plush yet small rump a gentle squeeze, Vahn sat up from the bed, allowing Circe to lay across his lap as he stroked her hair and said, "There is no rush...leave it to me..."</p><p>With her eyes glazed over slightly, Circe looked up into his face, the strength she had previously mustered now nowhere to be seen. Even then, she managed to say in an almost whimpering tone, "You have to take responsibility..." This was answered with an understanding nod by Vahn, followed by him planting a long yet tame kiss on her lips. He was aware that, even with her divine spark taken away, Circe's body still had a subtle influence on him. Making use of certain Laws for thousands of years gave a certain amount of familiarity with them so, despite the fact she had been drastically weakened, his body was beginning to heat up a bit.</p><p>After giving her a long kiss, Vahn ran his hand down the length of her body, marveling at how soft it was before snaking his hand between her thighs. This caused Circe to curl up in his lap while closing her legs fruitlessly around his hand. At the same time, Vahn sent Medusa an apologetic look with his eyes, causing her to surprise him a bit when she stuck out her tongue. He had expected her to leave the room and perhaps go take a bath, as she had nearly completed her Quest, but Medusa seemed to have very different intentions. Rather than excuse herself, she seemed to get a little excited by the scene playing out in front of her and, without removing the skin-tight bodysuit she wore to keep her body warm, she began fiddling with herself while observing his actions...</p><p>As he had already shared his fair share of intimate moments with Medusa, Vahn just shook his head with a wry smile as he turned his focus back to Circe. He knew that, despite the fact that she seemed to be lost in the pleasure wracking her body, she was paying close attention to him. Her ability to discern if people were paying attention to her was a part of her Innate so, during the brief moment he had turned his attention to Medusa, Vahn had felt the subtle fluctuations in her internal energy.</p><p>Understanding how important this moment was for her, he could only leave Medusa to her own devices as he shifted Circe's position so that she was seated leaning against him. This allowed him to fondle with her small yet inexplicably soft mounds as his finger slowly penetrated into her soft folds. He was immediately greeted by an unbelievable tightness which, given Circe's petite figure, wasn't too much of a surprise. In response, he craned his head down to nibble on her long ears, which she fortunately had retained, while lowering his left hand to her belly and gently rubbing her navel. He would periodically press into a few areas as, if she wasn't properly prepared, Circe's first time would likely be very painful for her...</p><p>Though he had already expected it, Circe's body suddenly tensed up in his embrace as her body curled in on itself like a shrimp. Her insides clamped up around his singular finger, causing it to briefly get imprisoned in her now vice-like folds. He could feel her rampant heartbeat through his finger as, with each quick contraction, the digit was pulled deeper into her interior, allowing him to feel her above-average body heat, at least for a 'human'. Fortunately, with her body easing out of her climax, the small flood of love juices, combined with his efforts in weakening the tensions of her muscles, allowed him to extricate his finger. It would have been easy to remove it by force but, with Circe only having the strength of a normal human, he didn't want to accidentally injure her...</p><p>With her rationale recovering, Circe looked down at the state of her own body before craning her head to look up at him, a pitiful look in her eyes as she whimpered, "I'm tired of waiting..." As she had already been a virgin for thousands of years, Circe's patience was quickly wearing thin, despite the fact she knew Vahn was just being considerate. She didn't care how much pain she would have to experience as, compared to losing her wings, it was simply incomparable. Since she was also very aware of Vahn's skills when it came to doing the deed, Circe knew any pain she experienced would be quickly replaced by pleasure. Thus, despite the fact she could hardly muster any strength in her already fatigued body, she did her best to turn around as she tried to push him down against the bed...</p><p>Resisting against Circe's efforts, Vahn showed a gentle smile before tilting her chin and giving her another kiss, this time keeping it to only a few seconds as he understood her eagerness. When he separated from her rather flavorful lips, Vahn repeated, "Just leave it to me..." as he quickly guided Circe's lower body so that she was straddling his hips. Though her ears began erect after she felt something hot poke against her backside, Circe still answered his words with a nod before placing her forehead against his chest, her eyes looking downward as she tightly clung to his body...</p><p>Vahn knew her body wasn't ready but, as Circe was already beyond the point of caring about things like pain, he quickly positioned himself at her soft and pliant entrance. It was somewhat ironic that this extremely pleasant sensation would soon be replaced by an unbelievably tight pressure but, as his penis began to gradually heat up due to the influence of Circe's body, he slowly plunged himself deep into her insides. By temporarily making it impossible for her insides to contract, there wasn't too much resistance, even as he tore through her hymen, but Circe still tensed up considerably. Her nails indented harmlessly into his skin as, due to there being zero-clearance, even blood wasn't able to escape from her insides...</p><p>Despite the very intense pain she was experiencing, Circe's expression showed a great deal of relief, even as tears welled up in the corner of her eyes. She released a hot sigh against his chest, enjoying the painful pulse in her body that indicated she had finally given herself to the person she loved. No matter what happened in the future, she would never forget this moment, causing her to squeeze Vahn's body as tightly as she could manage. In response, he also held her as tightly as her frail body could withstand, sending comforting energy into her body as their respective body heat flowed into each other.</p><p>Fortunately, Circe didn't try to goad him into moving as, now that they were connected, most of her anxiety had faded away. Thus, for the better part of ten minutes, Vahn helped her relax while doing everything in his power to make sure she would be able to enjoy things when she was ready to continue. This ended up being a little sooner than he expected as, while she leaned against his chest, Circe could see Medusa staring at her from the side. For a brief moment, their golden eyes locked on each other, causing the cheeky Gorgon to smile in a mischevious manner as she slightly parted her legs. Strangely, though she usually only cared about the attention of men, Circe felt her body heat up a bit after seeing what Medusa was doing.</p><p>Since much of the pain had faded away, replaced by a throbbing pulse that seemed to match her heartbeat, she moved her hips a little, an action that caused a small 'pa' sound as an unnerving amount of blood and viscous fluid flowed from her insides to coat Vahn's still visible shaft. This didn't deter Circe, however, as a small smile spread across her face after witnessing the proof of her maidenhood's sacrifice. Then, as the pain had mostly faded away, she looked up into Vahn's face and, without needing to say anything, he returned a gentle smile of his own before guiding her hips in a gentle yet steady motion...</p><p>(A/N: Alternate Titles: 'Circe's New Game+','Impatience : Union','Medusa likes to watch (o 3 o)...')</p><p>https://bit.ly/2XBzAYu &lt;-(p.atreon link)</p><p>paypal.me/Einlion</p><p>Discord Invite: https://discord.gg/mn5xMbE</p></main><div class="link-group"><a class="btn" href="01210.html">Previous</a><a class="btn" href="index.html">Table of Contents</a><a class="btn" href="01212.html">Next</a></div></div><div id="readpos">0%</div></body></html>
