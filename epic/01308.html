<p>Though it didn't make him feel as powerful as his normal Throne, Vahn found the one situated near the heart of the Hanging Gardens of Babylon to be comfortable. It had thick cushions on the arms, back, and seat area while, a stark contrast to the dark and awe-inspiring atmosphere that dominated his Throne Room, the central chambers of the Gardens was well lit by large crystals that cast gentle rays of light upon the various plants scattered in the surrounding area.</p><p>If not for the fact that the city below was still smoldering from the now-extinguished fires, despite several hours having passed, Vahn would have found the peaceful atmosphere very relaxing. Instead, he had a serious and focused expression on his eyes darted around, seeing far beyond the confines of the Gardens as he worked to protect those in need while punishing those who sought to exploit the chaos for personal benefit. This included the various people who, for reasons he would never be able to fathom, believed it was a good idea to take potshots at the Hanging Gardens from various places throughout the city...</p><p>From the moment the Hanging Gardens had been summoned, Vahn had been expecting a response from Solon or Zelretch but, even as the sun began its descent over the horizon, neither had deigned to appear. This seemed to imply their acquiescence but, as it hadn't really mattered if they were on the same page as him, Vahn impatiently awaited the moment when he would take to the stage once more.</p><p>With the Atlas Temple working closely with the Empire, Da Vinci had been able to integrate Shadow, the secondary system of Ark, into the telecommunications network of the entire planet. This allowed them to basically hack every computer system, television, and phone so, once everything was ready, Vahn would be addressing the world. Various news organizations had been streaming the incident since the start, some laying the blame for the city's destruction on the Hanging Gardens while others speculated whether or not the floating fortress was some kind of alien craft.</p><p>What annoyed Vahn the most about these news organizations is that, rather than focus on the actual crisis below, they were more interested in speculation and making the story sound more interesting to the people. They did everything they could to stir up their viewers, ignoring the fact that hundreds of homunculi were aiding people while the Gardens had simply been hovering silently for hours. He had known that the fortress would draw a lot of attention but, seeing how they basically ignored any positive aspects of this incident, all for ratings, Vahn was growing frustrated.</p><p>To further exacerbate matters, there had been helicopters flying around the periphery of the Gardens while, in the distance, jets were circling in a large perimeter. These were military craft, each armed to the teeth with advanced missile and targetting systems. Vahn could intercept the radio transmissions between them so he knew they were preparing for a coordinated attack.</p><p>Vahn knew there were people manipulating both the military and media from behind the scenes as Shadow was able to see their communications in real-time. If he wanted to, Vahn could shut down the entire network or prevent these messages from reaching their destination but, after everything that had happened, part of him wanted them to attack.</p><p>The more violent the response from the government and military, the more leverage Vahn would have in his upcoming address. He was willing to accept the hatred and ire of the entire world but, rather than conquest, the Empire would shape the world by setting an example and providing aid to those in need. At the same time, he would expose the evil hiding beneath the surface of society, all while simultaneously spreading knowledge of Thaumaturgy and supernatural phenomenon to the public.</p><p>It was high time that the people knew the truth about the world they lived in and, if they could not change course, their end would be of their own making. The Empire would not tolerate governments manipulating their people while a secret society of powerful individuals ran everything from behind the scenes. He would expose everything, including the fact that the planet itself was a living creature. If people could not see reason, he had no reason to pander to them and continue the destructive cycle that was leading the world to ruin...</p><p>Still, Vahn wasn't just going to arbitrarily sacrifice half the world's population just to prove a point so, while his right hand tapped impatiently against the Throne's armrest, his left held a miniature golden chalice that, from the moment he had pulled it out, caught Alaya's attention. This was the [Grace of the Root], the Unique item he had obtained after completing the [Cup of Heaven] Quest. It allowed him to make any wish within the world's power to grant so, while it had a rather simple appearance, the tiny golden chalice effectively had 100,000,000,000,000 units of magical energy sealed within...</p><p>---</p><p>While Vahn was idling about on 'her' Throne, Semiramis was sitting silently at the side in a chair that had been set out for her. She would periodically glare at him but, as Vahn had other things to focus on, he pretended not to notice. He knew she was just fishing for attention and, while he didn't mind teasing her under normal circumstances, now was neither the time nor the place. Semiramis herself was fully aware of this but she was still annoyed that Vahn had basically commandeered her Noble Phantasm for his personal use.</p><p>If she were being honest, Semiramis was actually a little happy that her hard work was being put to use; She just wished that Vahn had been a little more grateful. Instead, he had been sitting on her Throne staring off into blank space for hours. She knew he was focused on the crises below but, with multiple bodies at his disposal, he should have been able to spare her a few minutes as a courtesy, if nothing else...</p><p>Feeling that her presence was pointless, Semiramis ultimately rose from her seat before remarking in a cold tone, "I will be retiring to my bedchamber...if you break my Gardens, I will not rest until your stomach is black and shriveled."</p><p>Hearing Semiramis' remark, Vahn finally looked toward her and, seeing the raven-haired woman in a dour mood, he released a minute sigh. Had the circumstances not been what they were, he wouldn't have been so forceful in his actions. With this in mind, he gestured for her to come to his side and, though she just stared back at him at first, she eventually came over as called. He knew she must be thinking, 'Is this my chance...?' but, after everything he had experienced, Vahn wasn't so easily wiled.</p><p>Though Vahn hadn't given her leniency to do so, Semiramis opted to take a seat on his lap as her disposition changed in an instant. Before she was able to do something regrettable, Vahn took the initiative away from her, lightly pinching Semiramis' nose. This caused her expression to freeze, her lips slightly parted as if she couldn't find any words to express the incredulity and confusion she was experiencing as a result of the unexpected action.</p><p>Before she could recover, Vahn allowed a smile to return to his face as he remarked, "One day, I'd like to see a real smile on your face. Sorry if I upset you..."</p><p>As Vahn spoke, he gently caressed the confused woman's face before running his fingers down the long fringe bangs that framed her figure. She didn't notice it herself but her long elf-like ears had drooped slightly and, though she didn't blush, he could feel the turmoil of her emotions.</p><p>After finally collecting herself, Semiramis used her delicate fingers to remove Vahn's hand and, as if her heart wasn't racing, she maintained an elegant and dignified demeanor as she remarked, "You should not touch a lady without her permission...don't tell me even His Majesty is a base beast that doesn't consider the feelings of others...?"</p><p>Rather than be offended by Semiramis' biting remark, Vahn was more amused than anything else. He knew she was what people referred to as a Tsundere so she had a tendency to make harsh remarks whenever she felt embarrassed. This was one of the reasons he liked to tease her but, considering the circumstances, he just lightly poked her lower back with his index finger, remarking, "That is an interesting thing to say considering where you are sitting, Queen Semiramis..."</p><p>Though it didn't show in her expression at all, Vahn could sense Semiramis' heart beating madly in her chest as she lightly harumphed, her face turned away from him as she retorted, "I'm allowed to sit here whenever I'd like. You didn't even ask for permission before sitting on my Throne so don't try to lay the blame on me...how uncouth..."</p><p>This time, Vahn lightly chuckled in response to Semiramis' quip before moving his right hand to comb through her long black hair as he said, "You should go and rest. When all of this is over, I'll help you comb your hair as an apology..."</p><p>Hearing Vahn's remark, Semiramis turned to face him, her pale golden eyes, reminiscent of a snake, coming into focus as she stared back at him. Then, after squinting at him, she slowly rose to her feet before gliding toward a small chamber hidden at the back of the Throne Room. It wasn't until she had covered nearly half the distance that she finally decided to respond, her back facing him as she muttered, "It is a privilege to comb my hair...if you truly want to apologize, come up with something that isn't a reward for yourself..."</p><p>With her words finished, Semiramis continued toward her hidden bedchamber, her long hair flowing behind her like a cape as it magically slid across the ground without dirtying. It was nearly 200cm in length which, when compared to Semiramis' height of 167cm, made it seem even longer. She called it a reward but, considering it took nearly three hours to brush and style her hair, Vahn knew it was a laborious task that Semiramis enjoyed forcing upon others.</p><p>Despite this, Vahn decided he would come up with another form of apology but, with more pressing matters to attend, the smile quickly faded from his face, replaced by a stern and intense expression. The power grid itself had been damaged by the previous shockwave so, with dusk approaching, an all-consuming darkness began to descend upon London and the surrounding cities. Vahn knew this was the period when people would be at their worst while, under the cover of darkness, the military would soon begin its assault...</p><p>If they attacked during the day, it would be too easy for people to see that the military was attacking the Hanging Gardens one-sidedly. By waiting until the sun had gone down, they could spin the story into some grand tale of battle where both sides fought against each other. Some of the pilots even had orders to attack the ground, targetting the relief efforts directly for the sole purpose of lending credibility to the narrative they intended to spin.</p><p>With the government and military acting as the puppets of the various families, they would stop at nothing to try and make the Empire out to be the villain. To them, it didn't matter how many normal people died, so long as they were able to keep the power and authority they had accrued over the millennia. Rather, the more chaos they could cause, the easier it would be to shift the blame to the Empire as they desperately machinated behind the scenes.</p><p>At this point, the Noble families had realized that he wasn't going to keep playing around with them so, while many of the had been content to lay low, they were now forced into action just by the mere fact that Vahn was sitting idly in the Hanging Gardens. They had already moved their most important assets to 'secure' locations so, even if they started a war and lost 'everything', they would be able to avoid the fate of the Barthomeloi family. This was, of course, a mistaken belief on their part so, once they threw propriety out the window, Vahn wouldn't hesitate to do the same...</p><p>For now, however, he watched silently as the light of the sun slowly faded over the horizon...</p><p>(A/N: I'm starting to feel better but I'm still having a few coughing fits and a light fever. I'm getting plenty of fluids in my body and a lot of rest so I'm hoping to be back in working order soon. After this, I think I may need to reevaluate my dietary choices and other bad habits xD...)</p><p>https://bit.ly/2XBzAYu &lt;-(p.atreon link)</p><p>paypal.me/Einlion</p><p>Discord Invite: https://discord.gg/Jwa8PKh</p></main><div class="link-group"><a class="btn" href="01307.html">Previous</a><a class="btn" href="index.html">Table of Contents</a><a class="btn" href="01309.html">Next</a></div></div><div id="readpos">0%</div></body></html>
