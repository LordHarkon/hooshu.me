<p>Though he would have liked immediately returned to Avalon, Vahn had one final stop before doing so. He had already to return with Nero, so, rather than teleport to Avalon, he appeared outside of a buzzing and vibrant city with tall was, and, most notably, a massive tree situated the exact center.</p><p>Seeing the emerald-green tree, its leaves glimmering in a myriad of colors, Vahn felt couldn't help but feel slightly reminiscent. He knew Yggy wouldn't even perceive his absence, but, much like the rest of his 'children', Vahn missed her dearly. She had always been such a kind and caring child, and, though he could relax under the current crystalline tree, it simply wasn't the same.</p><p>Shaking his head, Vahn cleared his thoughts before vanishing into thin air moments later. When he next appeared, he was within one of the five palatial structures that had been constructed within the European Supercolony. There, surrounded by a handful of fluffy Companions, Nero was taking a nap while lounging atop an ornate throne, her features making her appear fragile and delicate as silent breathing emanated through the otherwise empty chamber.</p><p>Nero often worked herself tirelessly, even pulling long hours late into the evening to ensure there were no issues with the European Supercolony. The only reason she was currently resting was due to the previous message, stating Vahn would be arriving around 2 PM. Thus, in order to make sure she was free to receive him, Nero had taken a rare break. As for why she ended up falling asleep, the five adorable Companions surrounding her could be blamed for that. Their aura was very relaxing, so, if you cuddled with them for too long, you would feel an almost irresistible urge to just take a nap.</p><p>Seeing the golden-haired beauty peacefully slumbering, Vahn actually felt a little guilty having to disturb her. Unfortunately, just be appearing, he had already set off a chain reaction, as, noticing his presence, one of the Companions chimed in an adorable voice, "It's Master!"</p><p>Immediately after the first, the other four Companions peeled open their eyes, each showing gleeful expressions as they began exclaiming things like, "Master!", "Master has come!", "Master, come play with us!".</p><p>Accompanying their cries, two of the Companions even hopped off the throne, waddling adorably over to his side to grip his legs and snuggle against him with happy smiles.</p><p>Though they were still waiting for the first truly sapient Companion with an Ego to appear, Vahn was always amazed to see how much progress had been made. He wasn't the only one, either, as the tiny creatures had become 'exceptionally' popular after the preliminary discomfort faded. After all, it was hard to hate a creature that proactively did its best to make you happy, keep you safe, and help you grow stronger; especially if it was also cute...</p><p>Due to the noise caused by her adorable entourage, Nero's ahoge perked up slightly as her eyelids slowly peeled open, revealing the emerald-green irises beneath. A smile instantly spread across her face, further amplifying her flawless features as she muttered, "To think we would awaken from a pleasant dream, only to find an even more pleasant sight standing before us...perhaps we have yet to truly awake...?"</p><p>As she spoke, Nero appeared to move very languidly, but, by the time she finished her musings, she was already standing near Vahn, her hands stretched out as if she was going to caress his face. Then, so gingerly that it was almost impossible to feel her touch, Nero's fingers came into contact with his cheeks, causing her smile to increase a great deal as she said, "Our Master has personally come for us. Today is a blessed day, umu..."</p><p>After confirming that Vahn was 'real', Nero leaned forward, standing on the toes of her left foot as she raised her right somewhat theatrically. At the same time, she lightly placed her lips against his while, in the surroundings, rose petals had started to flitter into existence. It was quite the sight to behold, but, with a beauty in his arms, Vahn had more important matters to attend...</p><p>---</p><p>Several minutes after his arrival, Vahn was lounging upon the 'Throne of the Consul', the ornate chair that could easily fit three people seated side-by-side. He had Nero curled up in his lap, giggling as she asked, "What did you think of our performance? Was it enough to stir your bosom and arouse your passions? Umu~."</p><p>Seeing the petals still lingering in the surroundings, Vahn lightly chuckled before nodding his head and answering, "It is always a pleasure, Nero. Even without the theatrics, however, your beauty alone is more than enough to captivate me."</p><p>Finding her Master's words to her liking, Nero giggled happily while squirming about atop his lap in an effort to feel even closer to him. Then, after a series of several nods and a few gleeful 'umu', she happily mused, "Well said! Such words are enough to ignite the flame in our bosom into a raging inferno! Umu, mayhaps, if the fates allow, this one shall reward her Master's courteous diligence~?"</p><p>If he wasn't absolutely certain things would turn into a 'competition' of sorts, Vahn wouldn't mind taking Nero up on her offer. Unfortunately, while he had a few hours to spare, that wouldn't actually be enough unless he went 'all-out' against the otherwise insurmountable woman. Thus, as remiss as he was to refuse the offer, Vahn lightly shook his head, explaining, "The fates are not kind this day. I have other matters to attend, including a few pertinent to the Empire's prosperity. Instead, I will have you accompany me back to Avalon. Many of us will be retreating into Arcueid's Marble Phantasm for an extensive period of time. You've been working hard as of late...a vacation will, no doubt, enhance your beauty even further."</p><p>Hearing her Master's words, Nero's smile stretched to its limits as the thought of accompanying him for a long period of time was a rare privilege. The presence of others wouldn't diminish this, rather, it was always more exciting when other members of the Inner Sanctum were involved. The passage of a few 'years' within Avalon had brought about several changes, and, though she would occasionally butt heads with some of the stronger willed women, Nero now got along with the vast majority.</p><p>After learning the details of what her Master had in mind, Nero was even more excited, as, based on the context, there would only be a handful of people present, potentially for months. She felt like the fates were smiling upon her this day, rewarding her for several months of hard work. The only thing that could have made it better was if Boudica also accompanied them, but, as the red-haired beauty had never developed an intimate relationship with Vahn, it would be somewhat awkward asking her to attend...</p><p>With Nero up to speed, Vahn briefly considered whether or not he should inform Solon of what had happened before ultimately deciding against it. It wasn't that he didn't trust Solon, rather, after the latter became the Guardian Spirit of the World Tree, their Loyalty had skyrocketed. He could even get away with taking liberties, such as patting Solon's head, without any verbal protest. They would still glower at him, but, if he wanted, the peculiar green-haired Spirit would 'begrudgingly' acquiesce to his selfishness.</p><p>The simple fact of the matter was, due to Gaia's significance, it was better to prevent 'outsiders' from learning about her. Solon would undoubtedly want to meet Gaia, but, until he could be certain there was absolutely no danger, Vahn would keep her protected within Avalon. He wouldn't bring her out until his plan had been enacted, but, more important than that, he would never force her to venture outside unless she was willing.</p><p>Having made up his mind, Vahn embraced Nero tightly, teleporting them back the relatively short distance to Avalon. She could have easily returned on her own, not even taking an hour to do so, but it was always more meaningful when he personally went to pick his women up. They appreciated it a great deal, and, while it wasn't exactly efficient, matters of the heart often required delicacy, rather than expediency...</p><p>---</p><p>Shortly after the return of his second vessel, Vahn felt as if 'clarity' had been restored to his mind. It was always easier to have all of his bodies experiencing the same flow of time, allowing him greater control over his thoughts and actions.</p><p>Though it might be a little too early for her, Vahn met Gaia's gaze, saying, "There is a place I would like to take you. It may be a little scary, but I'd like to introduce you to my important people. In the future, they will also do their best to protect and make you happy. It may take some time, but I'd like it if you became friends with some of them..."</p><p>Despite being inside Tiamat's Marble Phantasm, Gaia was aware of almost everything taking place on her body. This didn't just include the Surface, either, but every Texture and Sub-Texture. After all, they were all a part of her. Thus, while she had been cradled in her Master's arms, Gaia knew what he had been up to in the outside world. Rather, if she sorted through her memories, she could see every action Vahn had ever taken since entering her world...</p><p>After staring in a daze for nearly a full minute, Gaia slowly nodded her head before nestling against her Master's chest and saying, "As long as I'm with Master...I feel safe..."</p><p>Feeling warmth spread through his heart in response to Gaia's words, Vahn put a little more strength into his embrace, assuring her, "I will protect you..."</p><p>-----------------------------------------------------------------</p><p>[Quest: Gaia's Champion]</p><p>Rank: SS</p><p>Objective(s): Protect Gaia until departure from the Record.</p><p>Optional Objective(s): Increase Rapport between Gaia and Alaya(0/100), Increase Rapport between Gaia and Tiamat(0/100), Help Gaia make Friends(0/10), Summon Grand Servants to protect Gaia(0/7).</p><p>Rewards: 900,000,000OP, Gaia's Loyalty permanently increased to 'Eternal Loyalty', 1x[Emblem of the Guardian God]</p><p>Failure Condition(s): Expulsion from the Record, Failure to complete Main Objective</p><p>Penalty: N/A</p><p>-----------------------------------------------------------------</p><p>Though his feelings were sincere, Vahn hadn't expected a Quest to suddenly appear out of thin air. It was actually a little annoying, as, for a fleeting moment, Gaia had smiled radiantly before closing her eyes and intoning 'Nn' in a contented tone...</p><p>Doing his best to regulate his emotions, Vahn decided to just be happy for the additional boon. Even though he didn't really need a quest to tell him he should protect her, it was never bad to have extra rewards. It also gave him a basic idea of what he could do to ensure Gaia's happiness, helping her to make friends, and, most importantly, making her feel safe.</p><p>Vahn did his best not to let it affect him, but he was actually a little shaken by the fact there was an Optional Objective to summon 'Grand' Servants. They were, without exception, the most powerful Heroic Spirits in existence. There was only one for each of the seven primary classes, and, despite a concerted effort, Vahn had been unable to summon a single one of them. This always made him feel a little worried, as, depending on the circumstances, the Grand Servants could have appeared as the enemies of the Empire.</p><p>While it was something he would need to verify later, the fact it showed up as an Optional Objective led Vahn to believe that the 'requirement' for summoning a Grand Servant was permission from Gaia herself. They supposedly only appeared when the world was endangered, so, with Gaia now exposed and vulnerable, there was a good chance her greatest protectors would answer the call. If this turned out to be true, Vahn's plans would become incomparably smooth moving forward. After all, a single Grand Servant was generally all it took to prevent cataclysmic events, rivaling even beings like Cath Palug in might...</p><p>Ignoring the temptation to immediately test his assumption, Vahn turned his attention to Tiamat and Alaya. They had been patiently observing everything that has been going on, seemingly with no end to their patience. Tiamat, especially, appeared just as happy as when he first arrived, if not more. As for Alaya, she had actually altered her appearance slightly, forgoing her general 'nakedness' in lieu of a form-fitting, somewhat futuristic-looking, bodysuit. This, strangely, enhanced her appearance quite a bit, causing Vahn to raise his brows slightly before smiling approvingly.</p><p>With the attention of both girls focused on him, Vahn stated, "This time around, I will have the two of you accompany me. Gaia will need everyone's support and this is a good chance for the two of you to get along with everyone else. Tia, you'll have to be on your best behavior. As for you, Alaya, I trust you have come to understand the value of ingratiating yourself to the others. The fastest method to realize your goal is to win the sincere approval of everyone else. I won't force you, but, at the very least, I'd like you to get along with your sisters..."</p><p>Alaya lightly frowned in response to her Master's words, finding them troublesome. She, of course, knew there was a fair amount of truth behind them, but, with the exception of the most powerful in Vahn's entourage, everyone else seemed 'beneath' her. She didn't have anything to say to them, as, in the grand scheme of things, anything worth talking about couldn't be disclosed. The only shared topic they could discuss was her Master, but, as she had built up some resentment towards all of his lovers, Alaya had no particular interest in getting along with them...</p><p>After sorting her thoughts far quicker than even the fastest supercomputer, Alaya ultimately nodded her head, stating, "I will cooperate..." in half-hearted tone. She could, at the very least, associate with her two 'sisters', as, at least in Gaia's case, they had the same objectives. The latter was also her other half, so, while Tiamat was something of a nuisance, Alaya could tolerate her if it meant being able to spend time with her Master and counterpart.</p><p>Though he could tell Alaya had no interest in associating with the members of the Inner Sanctum, Vahn wasn't going to force her. He would likely need to take action immediately after implementing his plan, but, by then, she would be freed from the restrictions placed upon her by Akasha. This was potentially dangerous, as there was a fair chance she might attack the others, but, after spending so much time together, Vahn believed Alaya would never do anything to intentionally harm him...</p><p>(A/N: Alternate Titles: 'What is love without theatrics and drama?','Unexpected boon','Vahn over here planting dangerous flags...')</p><p>https://bit.ly/2XBzAYu &lt;-(p.atreon link)</p><p>paypal.me/Einlion</p><p>Discord Invite: https://discord.gg/Jwa8PKh</p></main><div class="link-group"><a class="btn" href="01498.html">Previous</a><a class="btn" href="01500.html">Next</a></div></div><div id="readpos">0%</div></body></html>
