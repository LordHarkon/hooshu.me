<p>After a bit of deliberation, it was decided that, alongside Shiki Tohno, Vahn would be summoning Attila, Iskandar, Ozymandias, Nero, Bedivere, and, now that the current, former, Knight of the Round Table had been able to acclimate to the modern era, Lancelot.</p><p>At the time of his death, Gawain had regretted not allowing Lancelot to accompany them to the Battle of Camlann so, while he had some misgivings, he was not against calling upon his former comrade. As for Gareth, she had filled the void left by her treacherous mentor with her current Master, Vahn, and she had no intention of changing allegiances. Rather, the amount of fulfillment she got from following her new Master was something that, at times, kept her awake late into the evening...</p><p>With Galahad simply not caring in the slightest, the only opinion worthy of consideration was that of Mordred. She, however, didn't think much of Lancelot outside of a general acknowledgment that he was a powerful, albeit foolish, Knight. Since a repeat of history was all but impossible, especially with Lancelot existing as a Heroic Spirit, she didn't mind if a dozen were summoned, much less one.</p><p>This actually brought up a good point as, if he was so inclined, Vahn could summon similar instances of the same Heroic Spirit, each pulled from different, near-identical, timelines. His only reason for not exploiting this was the fact that, on a fundamental level, it just seemed 'wrong'. Exceptions could be made for people like Sc√°thach, as she shared a unified consciousness with versions of herself, but it would be invalidating the originality that distinguished most Heroic Spirits.</p><p>While people like Artoria might claim that they wouldn't be bothered by such things, as the ambition of the Empire preempted individual comfort, he knew it would bother her. She would, at times, stare 'menacingly' at Jeanne's, Okita's, and Lakshmibai's breasts, three girls that had very similar features to her own, albeit far more mature. If he summoned a version of her that, for reasons known only to the creator of the Nasuverse, had larger breasts, Artoria may very well be the one to pick a fight...</p><p>Since issues of status and identity would also become a problem, it was ultimately better to avoid summoning multiple instances of the same person. Though exceptions could be made in the case of Alter and Lily Class Servants, Vahn felt this was venturing into dangerous territory. Just imagining a Lily version of Sc√°thach filled him with a primal and inexplicable fear as it was already bad enough that he got thrashed by her adult self. He also had the distinct impression that the Lily version would be just as sensual as her adult self, making her a nightmare of promiscuity he would rather avoid.</p><p>This, of course, didn't mean he would avoid taking advantage of the Lily Class as, instead of calling upon the Iskandar that Artoria was familiar with, they had decided to summon the child version of the same Heroic Spirit. The chances of the adult Iskandar acting as he pleased were exceptionally high while, prior to his conquering days, he was known as a prodigious, kind, handsome, and, as could be expected, an ambitious yet idealistic youth.</p><p>Though he would never voice it, Vahn had a few expectations for the young Hero and, once things had started to settle, he hoped that one of his daughters may grow fond of the youth. His children really were growing quickly and, while he would never consider forcing them into anything like an arranged marriage, that didn't mean Vahn couldn't stack the deck.</p><p>Vahn feared what would happen if they ventured out into the world only to find that even the most powerful amongst humanity paled in comparison to their own strength. Most of the people that vie for their affection would be doing so with malicious intention so, if they found someone amongst the people he summoned, he could avoid interference from outside parties as much as possible...</p><p>With this in mind, Vahn had secretly invested a bit of his free time looking into the pasts of various heroes and, when the time came, he intended to summon a few to 'set an example' for the younger generations to follow. If they assumed new identities and distinguished themselves among those of a similar age group, Vahn felt the young Heroic Spirits would be able to guide future generations in a way adults simply couldn't emulate...</p><p>---</p><p>After finalizing a few details amongst the members of his Court, it didn't take long for Vahn to find himself within the Welsh Dragon's chamber, a place he was becoming intimately familiar with as of late. This time around, he had the usual entourage of Artoria, Gray, Merlin, and Da Vinci but, making a special exception, he had allowed Aoko, Arcueid, and Ciel to enter the chamber.</p><p>Each of the three girls had some form of natural resistance against the Welsh Dragon's Curse but, with the presence of Vahn and Merlin, this wasn't really necessary. As for why he had allowed them to enter the most secure region of Avalon, well, it was largely to grant Arcueid closure and Ciel some relief. The moment the two women met each other, a very solemn atmosphere spread between them and, taking even longer than the Court proceedings, Vahn's entry into the Welsh Dragon's Chamber had been delayed by the necessary clarification of a few things for Arcueid's benefit...</p><p>Needless to say, Arcueid was a little shaken to know that the first person she ever loved was about to be revived; literally days after she dedicated herself to another. Though she had long given up on pursuing him, the memories of their time together were something she had cherished, even during her self-imposed isolation...</p><p>Despite all of this, Arcueid didn't regret her decision as, no matter how much she loved Shiki, only tragedy awaited them. His Mystic Eyes of Death Perception had been slowly driving him crazy and, even if she extended his life by turning him into a Dead Apostle, the corruption of Vampiric Impulse would have resulted in the creation of a monster. She didn't want to have to kill him after being the one to prolong his life so, when the opportunity had presented itself, Arcueid abandoned her first love and sealed herself away once again.</p><p>It was Vahn that finally diverted the flow of fate, pulling her free from the endless stream of eternity that persistently threatened to drown her in its ruthless currents. He not only liberated her from the loneliness that had plagued her for centuries but, in the course of a single day, changed her fate in a way she never thought possible. Now, she wasn't even a True Ancestor anymore; her craving for the blood of others a distant memory, one she hoped to forget completely in due time.</p><p>Arcueid had so much appreciation for everything that Vahn had done that she didn't even know how to put it into words. His existence was akin to a person that had awakened someone from an endless nightmare, one which they had no hopes of freeing themselves from. He replaced the darkness, pain, and loneliness that had embodied her existence with hope, warmth, and a large number of people who, in a short period of time, showed her greater sincerity than she could have imagined. He even taught her what it meant to be a woman, something she had always feared but, deep down inside, craved...</p><p>Now, as she watched Vahn stand in the middle of an incredibly complex magic circle, Arcueid stood with her hands together; a sincere prayer for everyone's happiness emerging from the bottom of her heart. At her side, Ciel was on tenterhooks in anticipation while, opposite the blue-haired zealot, the red-haired Aoko stood with a thoughtful expression on her face. This was a significant moment for all of them, albeit for entirely different reasons. Then, with considerably less flair than expected, the light around Vahn increased in intensity before a familiar figure, one which overlapped perfectly with each of their memories...'popped' out of thin air...</p><p>---</p><p>After entering into the Throne of Heroes and isolating Shiki's name, Vahn wasn't surprised to find that the man formerly known as 'Death' qualified for the Assasin, Faker, Lily, and Alter Ego Classes. Shiki was known to use a series of small knives and daggers as his primary weapon so it would have been a little strange to find a Saber or Lancer version of him within the current time axis.</p><p>Unfortunately, due to him having died from natural causes, granting Shiki the [Transmigrator] perk and resummoning the original was a little difficult. While it wasn't much different than what he had done in the past, Vahn had seen some of the sequelae following Shiki's death, including the fact that Ciel had one of his eyes transplanted into her own with an exceptionally powerful seal.</p><p>The simple fact of the matter was that Shiki's death was too close to the current time axis as, in the case of Heroic Spirits like Mordred, there was always some 'variance' involved with the legacy. It was much easier to make changes within time periods that were closer to the Age of Gods as even Alaya had tweaked things to a considerable extent. Now, however, Vahn's presence served to stabilize the present so any small changes to recent events could have a drastic impact on the present moment...</p><p>Unsurprisingly, Vahn found that the [Transmigrator] perk itself, at least for his timeline's Shiki, wasn't even available. This was an important discovery as it meant the summoning of enemies and recently deceased allies, while not impossible, couldn't be achieved as easily as hypothesized. Rather, in order to transplant a person into his current sphere of influence, relative to the time axis, Vahn would need to prepare a vessel for them to inhabit, similar to Iris.</p><p>Vahn was once again reminded that his understanding of the Throne of Heroes was still shallow. He really needed to review the data that Da Vinci had been able to extrapolate from the information he had provided. The Throne of Heroes was one of the Empire's most powerful resources and, more so than almost anything else, he would need to understand it if he wanted to avoid tragedy.</p><p>After making a mental note to discuss his conjecture with Da Vinci later on, Vahn took a few deep breaths before his body, similar to how a cell would divide, split into two. Then, using the memories of the waiting girls, Vahn reproduced the twenty-year-old version of Shiki. The most familiar version of him would have been his sixteen-year-old self but, in order to make things easier for Arcueid, this was the simpler solution. It would also be easier for the matured spirit of Shiki to inhabit a body that was a little closer to his actual age; all while avoiding the awkward scenario of returning the twenty-eight-year-old version of himself to the perpetually sixteen-year-old Ciel's side...</p><p>Once everything was prepared, Vahn breathed out a tired sigh as he had the distinct impression that Shiki's presence would invite a fair amount of drama. Vahn didn't know what had happened to all of his former companions and harem potentiates but, with the reemergence of the young Hero, it was only a matter of time before they converged once again. After all, for reasons he would undoubtedly learn in the near future, every one of Shiki's love interests had some form of immortality.</p><p>Since he wasn't going to go back on his word, Vahn finalized his selection, transplanting the Ego of the original Shiki into the vessel he had prepared. This would undoubtedly be a jarring experience for the former protagonist as, prior to his death, Vahn knew he had shared a pretty emotional scene with his entourage. He couldn't really imagine what it would be like to believe you are dying, only to find yourself transplanted several years into the future, all while your body regressed in age...</p><p>As this peculiar thought was going through his mind, Vahn found himself back in the real world, the body of Shiki already floating in front of him. He had, fortunately, prepared clothes for the young man as, despite having been told to stay out of the summoning circle, Ciel tackled the man out of the air at the very instant his eyes opened. This caused Vahn to shake his head but, seeing the blue-haired loudly wailing in the very confused Shiki's arms, he decided not to mind it too much...</p><p>(A/N: Alternate Titles: 'At this point, I'd say Vahn is a confirmed schemer','Wibbly wobbly, timey whimey bullshit','I kind of feel bad for Shiki xD...')</p><p>https://bit.ly/2XBzAYu &lt;-(p.atreon link)</p><p>paypal.me/Einlion</p><p>Discord Invite: https://discord.gg/Jwa8PKh</p></main><div class="link-group"><a class="btn" href="01348.html">Previous</a><a class="btn" href="01350.html">Next</a></div></div><div id="readpos">0%</div></body></html>
