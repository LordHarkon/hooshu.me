<p>After dealing with Jason, Vahn ran his hand through his hair in a self-calming gesture before making his way back to where Chang'e was waiting. She had a somewhat forlorn expression on her face, so, with a gentle smile on his own, Vahn muttered, "This was one of the best ways this could have come to an end. If you are feeling lonely, I'm certain the other Heroes will readily welcome your presence. I will return by the day's end with Hou Yi in tow..."</p><p>Hearing Vahn's words, Chang'e offered a small smile in return, saying, "Thank you...I can tell that this wasn't easy for you..." while politely lowering her head.</p><p>Though he was tempted to just shrug dismissively, Vahn ultimately nodded in response to Chang'e's words. Jason was only a threat if ignored, so, by eliminating him early on, a lot of future troubles had been avoided. Still, that didn't make killing him easy, as, due to the nature of his Noble Phantasm, it was almost like killing people he cared about. Though this was pure sentimentality on his part, it still left a bad aftertaste in Vahn's mouth...</p><p>After exchanging a few parting words with Chang'e, Vahn alighted from the Moon Palace without looking back. At the same time, he made a personal promise to treat Medea, Atalanta, and Heracles better, even if this was only to ease his own heart. It had been some time since he exchanged toasts with the powerful Hero and, though he spent a fair amount of time with Medea and Atalanta, Vahn knew there was more he could do for them...</p><p>With these thoughts crossing his mind, Vahn flew several hundred kilometers in a relatively short period of time before coming to a stop and saying, "Transport me back to my territory."</p><p>In response to his utterance, Vahn felt a mildly annoying pull in his gut, followed by his surroundings changing in an instant. He could see that his territory had expanded a considerable amount in the few hours that had passed since he and Artoria set out. This was worth paying attention to, but, as he had other thoughts occupying his mind, Vahn only spent a few seconds scanning Avalon with his domain before teleporting directly into the false Inner Sanctum.</p><p>Vahn found Artoria and Tamamo patiently waiting for him in the room that, back on Gaia, had been converted into the Menagerie. It seemed that the Moon Cell was unable to replicate the changes he had made, but, after visiting the throne room, Vahn was already aware of this. This didn't stop Artoria and Tamamo from making themselves comfortable, however, enjoying tea as the former did her best to catch the latter up to speed on the Inner Sanctum's affairs.</p><p>Sensing Vahn's arrival before they actually noticed his appearance, both Tamamo and Artoria turned their gaze toward him. Immediately afterward, Tamamo bounced up to her feet, darting over to his location before sitting in seiza, bowing slightly as she mused, "Welcome home, Ten'nō-sama. I have already prepared a bath and a meal. Which would you prefer: dinner, a bath, or, perhaps...me~?"</p><p>Hearing Tamamo's offer, Vahn issued a light chuckle before ruffling her strawberry pink hair and saying, "I'm pretty greedy, you know? If you give me an offer like that, I'm tempted to take all three of them."</p><p>With a smile blooming across her face, Tamamo was prepared to hop up to her feet and strip down in an instant, but, before she could, Vahn added, "Patience, Tamamo. There are some things I need to discuss with Artoria. Be a good girl and wait patiently in the bathroom. I'll be along shortly."</p><p>Though the order was slightly askew, Tamamo wasn't going to disobey her husband's words, so, with a bit of pep in her step, she quickly alighted for the steamy bathroom. It was a little inconvenient, as she was still wearing her wedding kimono, but she didn't actually care about its integrity. Rather, she still harbored a small hope that Vahn would tear it off from her, spicing things up a bit. It was always more fun when things got a little intense, especially if the act was carried out without any malicious intentions...</p><p>After watching Tamamo depart, Vahn turned to Artoria, who, recognizing the look in his eyes, asked, "Are you okay?"</p><p>Without beating around the bush, Vahn released a small sigh before answering, "I will be, once we return home. For now, will you be joining us...?"</p><p>Understanding his intentions, Artoria shook her head, saying, "Even if she is behaving like that, this is still an important moment for Tamamo. I will go and discuss the organization of an occupying force with Gawain. We'll need to arrange personnel on the surface and within the Moon Cell if we want to prevent foreign occupation and any unexpected activation of the Moon Cell's functions. Da Vinci has already mentioned constructing a Bounded Field around the entire Moon, but she'll need both time and resources to complete the project."</p><p>As he had already heard about Da Vinci's terraforming projects, requiring the planting of a World Tree, Vahn nodded in understanding to Artoria's words. The Moon was the first step to branching out into the rest of the Sol System, so, while it would take a few years to achieve, Vahn knew it was only a matter of time before the barren surface became filled with lush greenery, unique fauna, and a small population of sapient creatures...</p><p>---</p><p>After escorting Artoria to the entrance of the Inner Sanctum, Vahn watched her retreating figure for several long moments before his figure vanished like a phantom. Then, while still wearing the yukata he had adorned earlier, he loosened his obi before entering the bath, where, with an expectant smile on her face, Tamamo was patiently waiting. She had set a large white towel on the ground so that her kimono wouldn't be dirtied, but, due to his Divinity, Vahn was able to ascertain her true nature without any difficulty.</p><p>From the moment she was a young girl, to the moment she had been chased out of the capital, the original Tamamo had been an Imperial Courtesan in the service of Emperor Toba. Though she was eventually elevated to the status of lady-in-waiting, destined to become his fourth wife, things had gone awry when her existence as a kitsune was exposed by a traveling Onmyouji.</p><p>Vahn knew he had much to learn about Tamamo's true past, but, for the time being, the important takeaway was that she was inordinately skilled when it came to matters between men and women. Though she had very few actual partners, it wasn't for no reason that she had become the Emperor's favorite Courtesan, the polite way of referring to a prostitute among the upper-class.</p><p>Tamamo's specialty, other than obedient service, was pandering to the ego of powerful men, happily ingratiating herself to others by reducing her status to that of a 'pet'. She liked to be pampered quite a bit, but, similar to Anubis, Tamamo had masochistic tendencies, enjoying being treated roughly, so long as the feelings of her partner were genuine. If someone tried to force her, they could really only blame themselves for the torment they would experience as a result of her curses and illusions...</p><p>Knowing what Tamamo expected from him, Vahn reached his hand near the base of her neck, tracing his fingers along her smooth skin as if, at any given moment, he might start choking her. This caused Tamamo's pupils to dilate slightly, her smile curling up at the edges when he forced her to look up at his face, her voice gaining a sultry undertone as she asked, "Ten'nō-sama~?"</p><p>Hearing the seductive growl contained within Tamamo's voice, Vahn's own smile became marginally more pronounced as he plainly stated, "I'll remove it for you later...for now, strip. I want to see if your beauty extends beyond your gem-like eyes and tantalizingly-inviting lips..."</p><p>If he hadn't insisted he would remove it later, Tamamo would have insisted that Vahn force her to remove her kimono. Since she hadn't detected any falsehood in his words, however, she didn't mind saving the main event until later, happily loosening her obi and allowing her fair white shoulders to slip out. This also revealed that fact that, much like Amaterasu, Tamamo was well-endowed, a deep and inviting valley that, at a glance, seemed to eclipse even Jeanne and Iris in size...</p><p>Not missing Vahn's momentary shift in focus, Tamamo's expression turned into a curious and teasing one as she asked, "Does Ten'nō-sama like them big or small? I'm not fond of using it, but I can freely change my size and shape using [Transformation]. See...?"</p><p>To prove her point, Tamamo made her bust increase from a sizeable 86cm to an eye-opening 95cm, enough to strain at the fabric of her kimono despite the fact she had already loosened it. This would have awed most men, but, as the ability to change their form was actually pretty common amongst his women, Vahn just smiled appreciatively as he answered, "I have no particular preference. Though there are times when I prefer large breasts, I've never had any complaints about smaller sizes. Rather, they have their own charm..."</p><p>Once again sensing no falsehood contained within Vahn's words, Tamamo's vulpine ears twitched a few times, her bust shrinking to a size that could easily fit in the palm of his hand. This also caused her kimono to slide down her shoulder, exposing her fair white skin and two buds, similar to cherry blossoms, to come into view.</p><p>Understanding she was 'testing' him, trying to feel out his preferences, Vahn smiled in amusement at Tamamo's antics, lightly tracing his thumb around her exposed nipple as he said, "They are cute."</p><p>Taking things several steps further than necessary, Tamamo's actual size rapidly decreased, changing her figure until it had reached a rather 'dangerous' point. This was enough to cause Vahn's smile to turn slightly awry, even if he had already seen it coming. Truthfully, her figure wasn't all that different from Circe's, but, knowing she was messing with him, he began to pat her head instead of touching her body, stating, "Don't push yourself..."</p><p>Not understanding Vahn's words, Tamamo tilted her head to the side, capitalizing on her 'innocent' appearance as she muttered, "Tamamo-chan isn't pushing herself though~?"</p><p>In response to her words, Vahn finished loosening his obi, allowing the folds of his yukata to open, revealing himself for Tamamo's benefit. This caused her face to display a seductive blush, believing she had found his 'strike zone', but, when she averted her eyes from Vahn's face to take in his full appearance, she instantly understood the meaning behind his words...</p><p>After recovering from her stupor, Tamamo's size adjusted to a happy medium between her default and busty counterpart. This allowed her to relax a bit, but, as Vahn wasn't exactly 'normal' below the belt, she still felt a little nervous as she mused, "Ten'nō-sama is quite magnificent...truly, there has never been a man more worthy of the title 'Sage Dragon Emperor'..."</p><p>Punctuating her words, Tamamo wasted no time in bending forward, her lips lightly kissing the tip of Vahn's glans as if it were the most natural thing to do at the moment. As for Vahn, he decided to let her service him during their bath, as, when they returned to the bedroom, things were bound to get a lot more intense. One of the primary reasons behind his rapid bedding of Tamamo was to prevent her from causing trouble back in Avalon, so, while he didn't intend to go all out, Vahn was prepared to meet, and exceed, her expectations...</p><p>Unaware of the fate that awaited her, Tamamo began to eagerly service Vahn, finding his scent, aura, and 'flavor' to be somewhat addictive. They made her body rapidly heat up, turning her cheeks red and causing her tail to twitch about in agitation. She was used to being in control during such times, but, even though he was just watching her with affection and amusement visible in his expression, Tamamo had the distinct impression everything was within Vahn's control...</p><p>(A/N: Alternate Titles: 'Tamamo's waifu power is quite high','The first steps to conquering the Sol System, nay, the entire Galaxy...!','Vahn spooked the loli out of her...xD')</p><p>https://bit.ly/2XBzAYu &lt;-(p.atreon link)</p><p>paypal.me/Einlion</p><p>Discord Invite: https://discord.gg/Jwa8PKh</p></main><div class="link-group"><a class="btn" href="01460.html">Previous</a><a class="btn" href="01462.html">Next</a></div></div><div id="readpos">0%</div></body></html>
