<p>As the days passed, some more meaningful than others, Vahn found himself hanging out with Siegfried as they both sat atop the castle's battlements. Since the Ivory Castle was built into an artificial mountain that had been constructed as the sealing grounds for the Welsh Dragon, it was easy to see all of Avalon from where they were seated. Since it was just about to turn January in the real world, the whole island had a deeply set chill that had caused the thousands of apple trees to frost over slightly due to the island's humidity. This had no effect on Vahn and Siegfried, however, as the latter was sitting with an open tunic while Vahn was wearing a thin dress shirt and a beige vest. Unlike a normal garment, however, there was a fashionable emerald gemstone near the collar that would allow him to adjust the color and tensile density of the fabric at will.</p><p>Since there had been a long lull in the conversation, as Siegfried was a man of few words, Vahn broke the silence by asking, "So, how are you settling in?" In response to this, Seigfried kept calm as the cool wind blew through his long silvery-white hair, an appreciative glimmer in his blue eyes as he answered, "This place is like a paradise. Everything is so calm and peaceful...had I not experienced the memory link and gained knowledge from the summoning system, I would have thought this place was the paradise promised to warriors after their death..." Though each day seemed to blend into the rest, Siegfried had found this kind of lifestyle preferable to the one where he had spent every waking moment granting the wishes of everyone who happened upon him.</p><p>Nodding his head in understanding, Vahn added, "It almost makes me not want to invite people to live here in the future. However, an Empire is nothing without its people and I can't just sit here idly as the rest of the world continues to spiral towards their inevitable destruction. There are days when I just want to go out into the world and visit a few hospitals, curing every patient I come across while the Doctors who had failed them watch on in awe. However, the moment I do something like this, the powers that have been biding their time in the shadows would immediately move to try and eliminate us. It is such a farce...we live in a world where things like food, clean water, and medical treatments are a luxury that only a few countries can afford. With things like Magecraft, all of these things could be resolved without any difficulty whatsoever but, instead of trying to help, the people that have all the wealth and power bide their time in the shadows without caring about the suffering their inaction begets..."</p><p>As this wasn't even remotely the first time Vahn had complained about such things, Siegfried gave a polite smile in response without commenting. He already knew Vahn's own inaction was driven by his desire to protect the people he cared about. Though this could be the same reason as some of the more powerful families in the world, it was also true that they had allowed the world to stagnate for their own benefits. Siegfried still didn't understand if the future Vahn sought for everyone was the best path to walk. However, so long as the latter did not become a despot or a tyrant, Siegfried had decided to walk the same path to its end. At the very least, Vahn seemed to genuinely believe that he could make the world a better place, something few had the power and conviction to see through...</p><p>From where they were seated, Vahn and Siegfried both caught sight of a small figure wearing a red leather jacket running down the long road connecting the Ivory Castle and the Castle Town below. Right behind the red figure, one with midnight blue hair exited behind her before turning back and waving at them. This caused the red figure to stop in its tracks, removing the golden-fur trimmed hood it had been wearing to reveal platinum blond hair with a slightly golden hue. Then, cupping her hands around her mouth, Mordred shouted in a voice that was only audible due to Vahn's enhanced hearing, "Chichiue~! Come fishing with us...!"</p><p>At his side, Siegfried laughed in a light-hearted manner before commenting, "I can understand why you want to protect this place...go, I'll be fine on my own." With that said, Siegfried shook his wineskin to indicate it was still full before jumping off the battlement, dropping 30m without needing to worry about injury. As for Vahn, he lightly pushed off the white stone surface as if he was completely weightless, flying through the air towards Fenrir, Mordred, and Susu. The latter had more or less been 'catnapped' by Mordred after the mischievous young girl discovered its existence. Vahn had seen his daughter chasing after the cat on all fours through the hallways, often with Susu finding sanctuary by fleeing into his arms. Currently, it was tucked into Mordred's coat, mewling pitifully when Vahn touched down nearby...</p><p>After saving Susu from Mordred, Vahn accompanied the two girls down to the repaired docks after passing through the rather lively ghost town. Though there weren't any people living there just yet, there were dozens of humanoid golems tirelessly working to repair all of the houses while, in the alleyways and beneath the streets, smaller, animal-like golems were repairing the sewer system and laying down the framework for Da Vinci's future network. Avalon could easily support upwards of 200,000 residents using the available land but Vahn actually had no intention of just letting anyone move here in the future. He was intending to turn Avalon into the heart of his Empire, making it into an academy-like city where people would tirelessly work to improve upon the concepts of Magecraft and what Da Vinci referred to as Magi-Science. The only permanant residents would be those given leeway to reside in the castle while everyone else would either be part of the staff or a student that would be required to leave after graduation...</p><p>Upon reaching the docks, Vahn sat Susu down to let her explore the beach while Fenrir and Mordred stripped down into their swimwear, consisting of Da Vinci's take on the Aegis Set, which she had taken to calling [Aegis Type D-001]. Though it actually lost some of its defensive capabilities, they were extremely comfortable to wear and were basically 'living' garments. Innovating off the concept of shaping energy into matter, and vice-versa, Da Vinci had designed an undergarment that could adapt to the needs of the user. If they felt cold, the fabric would move to cover more skin before generating a small amount of heat. Though this could actually lead to some compromising situations in the inverse situation, as the garments would basically shrink when you were overheating, that was easily avoided by making a small change in the magic formation sewn into the fabric.</p><p>Fenrir's Aegis took on the form of an athletic swimsuit that was cut a little high on the hips while Mordred, knowing she would get in trouble otherwise, wore an almost proper one-piece. The only peculiarity was that there was a gap around her navel that allowed her seal to be visible, something Vahn had confronted her about in the past. According to Mordred, she didn't like wearing anything around her midriff and, whenever the seal was covered, it would become unbearably itchy. Since he had confirmed this with his [Eyes of Truth] by having her wear a t-shirt, Vahn allowed her to keep it exposed during times like this. When she was walking around normally, however, he made sure she either wore loose clothing that wouldn't irritate her too much or, as she often preferred, Mordred would need to wear her jacket and have it zipped up. Since it was a size or two larger than it needed to be, Mordred didn't have to worry about the fabric touching her seal which, as the days passed, seemed like something that should be removed relatively soon. The only reason he hadn't was due to Mordred's own admission that it made her feel 'calm' to have it...</p><p>Since they were going to be 'fishing' in the cold waters, Vahn changed into a swimsuit that looked like a diving suit that didn't fully cover the arms and legs. Though it still showed off his figure, which had become 'slightly' more burly over the last few months, it was a compromise Vahn made so that Mordred would not deviate in the same way that Tina had. Fortunately, at least for the time being, this surrogate daughter of his treated him as if he were her biological father. Though she had gotten a spanking for trying to sneak into the men's bath when he was using it, that was just Mordred's innocent desire to wash his back and spend time together. Even so, Vahn was still cautious around her as, with the things she had seen and experienced in her past life, there was always a chance she would have some strange thoughts once she matured once again. Fortunately, for better or worse, she actually seemed to have a bit of puppy-love for Fenrir, something Vahn had already discussed at length with his most trusted companion.</p><p>Without waiting for permission, Mordred dove into the water before disappearing into the depths without any fear or hesitation. Vahn gave a small nod to Fenrir, sending her to look after Mordred as he walked into the water without hurrying. It was so cold that, if not for the salt content and the fact that the seas were rather rough around this time of year, it would have frozen over. This didn't really affect him all that much but it still caused his own Aegis to thicken before the cold was replaced by a warm sensation. Vahn was often amazed by Da Vinci's creations and, as he had just been talking to Siegfried about the future, he wondered if it wouldn't be better to start spreading her innovations and Paracelsus' research into the wider world...</p><p>While Vahn was thinking about leaving Avalon for a short while, a plump of water erupted around thirty meters away. Following this, Mordred could be seen bobbing in the water as she lifted up a large Smoothound Shark that was even bigger than she was. Judging by the trail of blood leading from its mouth and nose, it was easy to see that Mordred had killed the shark as she happily swam towards him with a face that practically screamed, 'Praise me'. Vahn placed the large catch into his Inventory before rubbing Mordred's head and saying, "Well done. When we get back, I'll help you brush the salt out of your hair." Though it didn't seem to bother her at all, there were small icy salt crystals forming in Mordred's hair from the cold air and the water molecules instantly freezing over.</p><p>With an even bigger smile than before, Mordred exclaimed, "I'll catch an even bigger one this time! I saw a fat tuna swimming around, shishishishi~." As she said this, another plume of water shot up in the distance, catching both Vahn's and Mordred's attention. Then, as if to spite the little Knight's claim, Fenrir could be seen paddling towards them while carrying a massive tuna through the water. This caused Mordred to tilt a few degrees to the side, at least until Vahn ruffled her hair and said, "Sharks are a lot harder to catch than Tuna." Though the latter could be much faster, they didn't have the same means to protect themselves that small schools of sharks had. Smoothounds could often be found traveling in packs so Mordred must have fended off a few of them before she came back with her prize. They weren't aggressive by nature but, if you antagonized their pack, they would try to help out their kin by ramming their foes...</p><p>Since she hadn't been all that upset in the first place, Mordred nodded her head before raising her nose high and proclaiming, "Of course~! If not for this seal, I would be even stronger than Aneue!" As she had a habit of using formal addresses, Mordred referred to both Nobunaga and Fenrir with the term 'Aneue', meaning Big, or Older, Sister. This was a way of showing respect as, even though she was the 'Imperial Princess', Mordred still had a wild and tomboyish nature while placing a heavy emphasis on things like respect. Since Nobunaga was someone she aspired to be like, and Fenrir was more or less her best friend, they were both worthy of being Mordred's Aneues, at least in her mind.</p><p>While Fenrir brought her catch over to Vahn in exchange for a few head pats, Mordred had already dived back into the water, though not before shouting, "I'm going to catch a whale...!". Though her strength was only around eight times stronger than a normal human, Mordred had proven in the past that such things didn't matter to her. A few weeks prior, during their first fishing expedition, she had attacked a pod of Killer Whales, taking out three of them on her own while Fenrir had dealt with the rest. It was for this reason that Vahn essentially had Fenrir babysit Mordred while, after being 'saved', the latter had been crushing on the former ever since.</p><p>---</p><p>After scaring off every fish for a few kilometers, Vahn used a bash of warm and clean water to help Mordred and Fenrir clean themselves before they changed back into their casual wear. While they did that, Vahn went to fetch Susu, luring it out of a small seaside cave with some fragrant baked fish. It sometimes felt like the black cat, now fully grown, was trying to 'escape' the castle but, as Vahn often treated it well, it hadn't run away just yet. To give it the strength to keep up with his daughter, Vahn fed it some mana-rich fish while using his petting laws to lightly stroke its fur. When it got a bit stronger, Vahn was going to teach Mordred how to perform a Familiar contract, greatly increasing Susu's lifespan and allowing them to share their vision with each other. Depending on how well Mordred cared for her, Susu could even become a 'Magical Beast' in the future, a term given to any Familiar that had reached an intelligence comparable to humans.</p><p>With a pacified Susu curled up and purring in his arms, Vahn returned to the docks where Fenrir and Mordred were already waiting for him. He returned the extremely reluctant Susu back to Mordred before handing the latter a few dried anchovies to keep the cat from running away. Thus, after tucking Susu into her coat, Mordred hugged the cat from behind while feeding it small fishes as they leisurely returned back to the castle. When they made it inside, Vahn made good on his promise to brush Mordred's hair, though not before she and Fenrir went off to take a warm bath. He spent the time while they were away talking with Artoria about preparing a large fish-themed feast while drinking some black tea. Like this, another comfortable rest period came to an end, making Vahn feel that Siegfried's remark about this place being a paradise was very close to the truth...</p><p>---</p><p>Several hundred kilometers away from the secret location of Avalon, a man with pale hair and dull-gold eyes sat in a steeply reclined chair as he looked through a large telescope that dominated the space within his observatory. With the New Year only a few days away, it was one of the best times to read the stars as the hopes and dreams of mankind made such forms of Thaumaturgy more powerful during the holiday season. He had a perpetual smile on his face as he recorded his findings</p><p>on his terminal while, a little bit away from the main telescopic array, a young woman with similarly colored hair sat nursing a cup of hot cocoa as she watched her father work. She had a peculiar side-braided hairstyle with the left side of her hair tied up while her bangs partly covered her right eye. Most would consider a very beautiful woman but, a stark contrast to her father, she had a perpetual scowl as, being the next Head of the Animusphere family, she knew the dire straits they were in...</p><p>Once he had completed his measurements, the man in the telescope's chair began stroking his chin in a thoughtful manner as he muttered, "This is my tenth time confirming the same things. If events proceed as they are scheduled, there is a good chance the world will experience a cataclysm in the next ten years...how curious that the signs for great fortune also seem to accompany it..." In response to this mumble, the young woman at the side released a tired sigh as she complained, "Knowing the future doesn't help us if we can't even do anything about the present. Father, have you reconsidered trying to ally with the Edelfelt family? The Barthomeloi family has been putting increased pressure on our creditors ever since you defended Lord El-Melloi II. We're already shouldering more than seven million pounds in debt...we can't continue like this..."</p><p>Though he knew the matter was even more serious than his daughter was aware, Marisbury didn't allow it to show on his face as he looked over and said, "Olga...Madam Edelfelt is still a member of the Aristocratic Faction. Though she may be willing to help us on account of our defense of Lord El-Melloi II, our opposition would not hesitate to point out a conflict of interest to destabilize our position within the Democratic Faction. Unless we had proper collateral to exchange, there is no way we would be able to survive under such scrutiny. Do not worry, as the readings still show that our family is on the path towards Great Fortune. For now, we must simply do our best to tide through these matters and trust that our methods are not the farce other members of the Mage's Association consider it to be..."</p><p>Having grown up hearing the mockery of her peers and contemporaries, Olga shared her father's determination to prove that Astronomy and Divination were still just as relevant today as they had been during the Age of Gods. However, some things in life couldn't simply be dealt with by sitting idle and trusting in prophecies. As it had been her own field of study since she was a young girl, Olga knew any significant event set in motion by a person with enough power could drastically alter the accuracy of predictions based on the stars. The very reason their Animusphere family was in such dire straits was due to her Grandfather insisting on the accuracy of his own prediction. As a result, their family had been saddled with a phenomenal debt that, through her father's efforts, had been largely reduced. Now that their creditors were growing impatient, however, time was quickly running out for their family while, instead of taking any proactive action, her father was repeating the same mistakes as his own...</p><p>With a tired sigh, Olga looked into her father's eyes with a determined expression, saying, "I have been in contact with the Trambellio family. Their-." Before she could continue any further, her father showed a rare grimace as he plainly stated, "Olgamally Marie Asmleit Animusphere, I will not hear you speak on that matter a second time. Though I do my best to respect your decisions, I will not have my daughter become the plaything of that despot just to gain protection from the Barthomeloi family. You are to be the next Head of the family and sincerely believe marrying that man would provide us any meaningful benefits? Our whole family would become a branch of the Trambellio family while you would effectively be nothing more than a pet of aman nearly twice your age. If you intend to try and go through with this, I will not hesitate to remove your right of succession..."</p><p>As she didn't like the thought of becoming a middle-aged man's wife any more than her father, Olga's face formed into a sour and angry expression as she shouted, "I'm trying to prevent our family from being ruined! We can't just keep sitting around and 'hoping' things will go well for us when the Bathomeloi family is breathing down our neck! The Trambellio family is one of the Three Great Magus families so even that arrogant Queen will have to hesitate if she wants to act against us in the future!
